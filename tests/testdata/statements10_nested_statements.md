- There is a class: 'identity matrix' @en
- There is a relation: 'has number of rows'
- There is a relation: 'has number of columns'
- There is a general statement:
    - formalized setting:
        - 'In' is an instance of 'identity matrix'.
        - 'n' is an instance of 'integer number'.
        - 'In' 'has number of rows' 'n'.
        - 'In' 'has number of columns' 'n'.
    - formalized assertion:
        - For all 'i' from 1 to 'n':
            - For all 'j' from 1 to 'n':
                - AND
                    - There is an if-then-statement:
                        - formalized premise:
                            - There is an equation:
                                - full source code: i == j
                        - formalized assertion:
                            - There is an equation:
                                - full source code: 'element of sequence'(In, i, j) == 1
                    - There is an if-then-statement:
                        - formalized premise:
                            - There is a mathematical relation:
                                - full source code: i != j
                        - formalized assertion:
                            - There is an equation:
