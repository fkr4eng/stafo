- // snippet(1)
- // later defined class is related to earlier defined one
- // right now this is solved by just moving class signal up
- There is a class: 'Eingangssignal'.
- There is a class: 'Signal'.
- 'Eingangssignal' is a subclass of 'Signal'.

- // snippet(2)
- // even harder a complete ring
- // no matter what comes first (A or B), you cannot create the first class completely
- There is a class: 'A'
- There is a class: 'B'
- There is a relation: 'has some relation to'
- 'A' 'has some relation to' 'B'
- 'B' 'has some relation to' 'A'
