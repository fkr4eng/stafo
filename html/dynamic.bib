In conjunction with a careful reuse of data, this technique also improves performance of programs involving linear algebra computations mixed or not with automatic differentiation.

With their ability to adapt volume flow, they have the potential to adjust volume flow according to the specification at hand and thereby to increase energy efficiency. In this paper, a nonlinear volume flow approach for a variable displacement vane pump is suggested based on input–output linearization. A nonlinear observer concept based on high gain state estimation is presented, too. Ultimately, a feedforward linearizing control concept with PI output feedback is discussed as an alternative to the full state feedback input–output linearization approach.},

The solution of this “variance equation” completely specifies the optimal filter for either finite or infinite smoothing intervals and stationary or nonstationary statistics. The variance equation is closely related to the Hamiltonian (canonical) differential equations of the calculus of variations. Analytic solutions are available in some cases. The significance of the variance equation is illustrated by examples which duplicate, simplify, or extend earlier results in this field. The Duality Principle relating stochastic estimation and deterministic control problems plays an important role in the proof of theoretical results. In several examples, the estimation problem and its dual are discussed side-by-side. Properties of the variance equation are of great interest in the theory of adaptive systems. Some aspects of this are considered briefly.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract For the stability analysis of linear time-invariant descriptor systems two
different generalizations of the classical Lyapunov matrix equation are considered.
The first generalization includes the singular matrix related to the time-derivatives
of the descriptor variables in an obviously symmetric form; the second one shows
at a first sight no symmetry which additionally has to be asked for explicitly. This
second approach is well-known for ‘admissible’ descriptor systems which includes
a restriction to systems of index k = 1. In this contribution the second approach
will be generalized to systems with arbitrary index k >= 1. Both approaches will
be compared with each other showing different solvability conditions and different
solutions in general. But for the problem of analyzing asymptotic stability the solu-
tion behaviors of the two generalized Lyapunov matrix equations coincide. In spite
of the different procedures both approaches lead to the same Lyapunov function
for the analysis of asymptotic stability of linear time-invariant descriptor systems.
The two approaches will be illustrated by the stability analysis of mechanical
descriptor systems, i.e. by mechanical systems with holonomic constrains. Although
the application of the approaches usually is very costly, they represent suitable tools
for the stability analysis of linear time-invariant descriptor systems.},

The method constitutes an alternative approach to the design methodology recently proposed by Baumann and Rugh. Also a review of different transformation methods for non-linear systems is presented. An example and simulation results of different control strategies are provided to illustrate the design technique.},

Despite being seemingly a simple system, the acrobot comprises many important difficulties when controlling the most challenging underactuated system - the walking robot. This paper presents the design of the asymptotical tracking of the prescribed trajectory generated by a suitable open-loop input of the acrobot. Such a design is based on the partial exact linearization of the third order combined with a certain robust stabilization technique. The proposed control is then demonstrated by the exponential tracking of the walking-like trajectory of the acrobot. Besides theoretical proofs, our approach is supported by numerical simulations and illustrated by acrobot movement animations.},

It is first shown how the Routh algorithm can be modified to serve as a criterion for positive realness. Due to the outstanding algebraic simplicity of the Routh algorithm, this criterion yields an efficient numerical procedure for testing positive realness. Once the Routh algorithm is successfully reformulated, the Hurwitz version of positive realness is almost automatic. Hurwitz-like determinants are obtained, which provide explicit conditions for positive realness often desired in the theory of networks and systems. The matrix generalization of the proposed Routh-Hurwitz criteria lead to numerical procedures for testing the positive real character of real rational matrices with desirable simplicity and suitability for machine calculations.},

  Abstract                 = {A previous paper [1] introduced a set of structural archetypes for coherency (SAC). Each SAC represented a set of structural conditions that caused a group of generators to remain-coherent for any disturbance outside the group (DOG). The present paper extends this concept by considering combinations of the basic SAC. It may happen that a particular group of generators within a power system (PS) does not fully satisfy the conditions for any one SAC, yet by partially satisfying the conditions for two or more of the SAC, the group may still remain coherent for any DOG. Using a linear model of the PS, two such possible combinations are considered and classified as either strong or weak linear decoupling (LD). The LD conditions combined with the original SAC form a hierarchy of structural conditions that cause coherency of a group of generators. An algorithm is presented for detecting a subset of these structural conditions. Three types of equivalents, parochial, local and global, are distinguished that exploit different SAC conditions Results of applying this algorithm to the 39-Bus New England System are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Peripheral milling is one of the most widely used and important method for shaping wooden work pieces. Unfortunately, there are some surface quality issues related to peripheral milling, especially when the feed speed is high. The wavy structure that is obtained is called a cutter-mark and is inherent in the kinematic process of peripheral milling. Reduction or removal of this wavy structure requires sanding or other operations afterwards. This obviously leads to extra time and costs. The authors presented a new mechatronic approach which can be used to eliminate the cycloid motion of the cutting-edge. The machine spindle position is moved periodically in one dimension to generate a linear motion of the cutting edge parallel to the work piece surface. In this paper the approach is used for the complex case when there are multiple cutting edges.},

paper, we propose a robust control system design method based on more efficient special QE
algorithm for SDC using Sturm-Habicht sequence. This method has better worst-case complexity
than that using D.˘Siljak’s criterion and a nice specialization property.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a new method with a software tool for parametric robust control synthesis by symbolic-numeric computation. The method is a parameter space approach and it is especially effective for analysis and design of fixed structure controllers of rational type. The real quantifier elimination (QE), which is one of the recent progresses in the symbolic computation, plays a key role in our development The QE-based approach can uniformly deal with a lot of important design specifications for robust control such as frequency restricted H∞ norm constraints, stability (gain/phase) margin and stability radius specifications, and pole location requirement by reducing such specifications to a particular type of formulas called a "sign definite condition (SDC)". This is also useful for improving the efficiency of QE computations since we can utilize an efficient QE algorithm specialized to the SDC. We have developed a MATLAB toolbox for robust parametric control based on a parameter space approach accomplished by QE. The QE-based parameter space approach and numerical simulation of specifications for specific controller parameter values taken from a controller parameter space are integrated conveniently in our toolbox with the assistance of a graphical user interface. This enables control engineers to achieve multi-objective robust controller synthesis smoothly. We also discuss how to merge the numerical computation and the symbolic operation to make our new design methods more efficient in practical control design.},

This paper shows how this and a number of other linear system theory problems can be simply reformulated so as to allow application of known algorithms for solution of the existence question, with the construction problem being solved by some extension of these known algorithms. The first part of the output feedback problem is solvable with a finite number of rational operations, and the second with a finite number of polynomial factorizations. Other areas of application of the algorithm are described: Stability and positivity tests, low-order observer and controller design, and problems related to output feedback. Alternative computational procedures more or less divorced from the known algorithms are also proposed.},

It provides a nonlinear generalization of finite gains with respect to supremum norms and also of finite L2 gains. It plays a central role in recursive design, coprime factorizations, controllers for nonminimum phase systems, and many other areas. In this paper, a newer notion, that of integral input-to-state stability (iISS), is studied. The notion of iISS generalizes the concept of finite gain when using an integral norm on inputs but supremum norms of states, in that sense generalizing the linear “H2” theory. It allows one to quantify sensitivity even in the presence of certain forms of nonlinear resonance. We obtain several necessary and sufficient characterizations of the iISS property, expressed in terms of dissipation inequalities and other alternative and nontrivial characterizations},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of the paper was to analyze the given nonlinear problem by different methods of computation of the Lyapunov exponents (Wolf method, Rosenstein method, Kantz method, the method based on the modification of a neural network, and the synchronization method) for the classical problems governed by difference and differential equations (Hénon map, hyperchaotic Hénon map, logistic map, Rössler attractor, Lorenz attractor) and with the use of both Fourier spectra and Gauss wavelets. It has been shown that a modification of the neural network method makes it possible to compute a spectrum of Lyapunov exponents, and then to detect a transition of the system regular dynamics into chaos, hyperchaos, and others. The aim of the comparison was to evaluate the considered algorithms, study their convergence, and also identify the most suitable algorithms for specific system types and objectives. Moreover, an algorithm of calculation of the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents based on a trained neural network has been proposed. It has been proven that the developed method yields good results for different types of systems and does not require a priori knowledge of the system equations.}

It has been shown that the introduced concept of phase transition allows for further generalization of the problem. The concept has been extended to a so-called noise-induced transition, which is a novel transition type exhibited by nonequilibrium systems embedded in a stochastic fluctuated medium, the properties of which depend on time and are influenced by external noise. Colored noise excitation of a structural system treated as a system with an infinite number of degrees of freedom has been studied.}

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a new framework of observer error linearization problem is proposed. The main idea of our approach is twofold. The one is to introduce an auxiliary dynamics whose input is the system output, and the other is to transform the augmented system into an observable linear system with an injection term which contains the system output as well as the state of the auxiliary dynamics. It is a natural extension of the recently developed dynamicobserver error linearization where the injection term contains only newly defined output. It is also shown that whenever an n dimensional system is immersible into an View the MathML source dimensional linear system up to an output injection, then it can be also dynamically observer error linearizable in our sense with a d dimensional auxiliary dynamics. Moreover, we show that the converse is not true by providing a counterexample, which implies that our approach is applicable to a strictly wider class of systems than that of the system immersion method.},

sum of a known number of sinusoids with known frequency
(amplitude and phase are instead unknown). Due to the non-
minimum phase nature of the considered systems, the direct
tracking by standard sliding mode methods generates unstable
behaviors of the internal dynamics. The proposed method
relies on the properties of differentially flat systems under
mild assumptions relevant to the relation between the original
output and a suitably designed flat output. As a result the
original problem is transformed in a state-tracking problem of
invertible stable systems, where any internal state turns out to
be bounded.},

Actually, there is no efficient kinematic formalism for these systems which are generally characterized by their high number of actuators. So, kinematic modelling is presented with particular emphasis on redundancy. Whereas kinematic redundancy is well known in the holonomic case, it is pointed out that it is necessary to define velocity redundancy in the case of nonholonomic systems. Reduced velocity kinematics based on quasi-velocities are shown to provide an efficient formalism. Two examples of mobile manipulators are presented. Finally, reduced velocity kinematics and velocity redundancy are shown to be adequate tools in order to realize operational task while optimizing criteria such as manipulability.},

Its special triangular form allows to apply sinusoidal inputs to steer the system locally. Moreover, we show how to derive from the proposed canonical form an estimation of the metrics induced by the shortest feasible paths. This estimation holds at regular points as well as at singular points. All these results are illustrated by the example of a mobile robot with trailers},

The genesis of this version of the criterion is described in detail, with the transcription and translation of a number of relevant manuscripts. Also translated for the first time is the seminal paper by Wischnegradski on governor dynamics, which greatly influenced Stodola's approach to control-system analysis and design. },

Der Engpass bei dieser Verfahrenskombination besteht in der Poliertechnologie. Aufgrund der beim Polieren erzielbaren geringen Abtragraten und der Forderung, die nach der schleiftechnischen Feinbearbeitung verbleibende Randzonenschaedigung zu entfernen, kann der Poliervorgang in Abhaengigkeit der Staerke der Randzonenschädigung mehrere Minuten bis hin zu einigen Stunden betragen (Bild 1). Um die Gesamtdurchlaufzeit deutlich zu verkuerzen, widmen sich daher aktuelle Forschungs- und Entwicklungsaktivitaeten der Reduktion von Randzonenschaedigungen durch das Feinschleifen.},

There is now a large and growing literature on the extension of these ideas to the multiinput/multioutput case. This development has posed certain difficulties, some due to the intrinsic nature of the problem and some, we would argue, due to an inadequate reflection on what the multivariable problem calls for. In this paper we describe what seems to us to be the natural multivariable analogs of these concepts from classical control theory. A rather satisfactory generalization of the Nyquist criterion will be described, and a clear analog of the asymptotic properties of the root locus will be obtained in the "multiparameter" case. However, an example is given which illustrates the quite surprising fact that the root locus map is not always continuous at infinite gains. This calls for a new ingredient, a compactification of the space of gains, and perhaps the most interesting new feature in this circle of ideas comes in the area of pole placement. This problem is difficult in the multivariable case, but by establishing a correspondence with a classical set of problems in geometry, we are able to understand its main aspects and to derive results on pole placement by output feedback over the real field.},

The invariance of certain quantities under feedback are established, and it is shown that these quantities contain enough information to determine if the system can be linearized using feedback and change of coordinates.

This paper extends the singular value decomposition to a path of matricesE(t). An analytic singular value decomposition of a path of matricesE(t) is an analytic path of factorizationsE(t)=X(t)S(t)Y(t)T whereX(t) andY(t) are orthogonal andS(t) is diagonal. To maintain differentiability the diagonal entries ofS(t) are allowed to be either positive or negative and to appear in any order. This paper investigates existence and uniqueness of analytic SVD's and develops an algorithm for computing them. We show that a real analytic pathE(t) always admits a real analytic SVD, a full-rank, smooth pathE(t) with distinct singular values admits a smooth SVD. We derive a differential equation for the left factor, develop Euler-like and extrapolated Euler-like numerical methods for approximating an analytic SVD and prove that the Euler-like method converges.},

For each type of nonholonomic constraint, the Boltzmann-Hamel equations produce a concise set of dynamic equations. These equations are similar to Lagrange's equations and can be applied to mechanisms that incorporate that type of constraint. A small library of these equations can be used to efficiently analyze many different types of mechanisms. 
Nonholonomic constraints are usually included in a La grangian setting by adding Lagrange multipliers and then eliminating them from the final set of equations. The ap proach described in this article automatically produces a minimum set of equations of motion that do not include Lagrange multipliers},

The continuous time state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) technique is extended to discrete-time under input and state constraints, yielding constrained (C) discrete-time (D) SDRE, referred to as CD-SDRE. For the latter, stability analysis and calculation of a region of attraction are carried out. The derivation of the D-SDRE under state-dependent weights is provided, and the result is compared with that of D-SDRE obtained by using the discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation (DARE) and that of discrete-time linear quadratic regulator (D-LQR). Stability of the D-SDRE feedback system is established using input-to-state stability (ISS) approach. Receding horizon strategy is used to take into account the constraints on D-SDRE controller.},

  Abstract                 = {Output tracking control of non-minimum phase systems is a highly challenging problem encountered in the control of flexible manipulators, space structures, and elsewhere. Classical inversion provides exact output tracking but leads to internal instability, while recent nonlinear regulation provides stable asymptotic tracking but admits large transient errors. As a first step to solve this problem, this paper addresses the stable inversion of non-minimum phase nonlinear systems. Using the notions of zero dynamics and stable/unstable manifolds, an invertibility condition is established for a class of systems. A stable but non-causal inverse is obtained offline that can be incorporated into a stabilizing controller for dead-beat output tracking. This inverse contrasts with the causal inverse proposed by Hirschorn where unstable zero dynamics result in unbounded inverse solutions. Our results reduce to those of Hirschorn for minimum phase systems, however. In a numerical example, the stable inverse has achieved much superior tracking performance as compared with that produced using nonlinear regulation.},

In this paper, Ni-Ti SMA wires are inserted during the weaving of a glass fiber reinforcement textile. This “active” reinforcement is then combined with an elastomeric matrix to produce a highly flexible composite sheet, which maintains high rigidity in the longitudinal direction. By activating the SMAs, high deflection ratios of up to 35\% (relative to the component's length) are achieved. To adjust the composite's deflection to defined values, a closed-loop control is set up to adjust the current flow through the SMA wires. A control algorithm is designed and evaluated for several test cases. The high deformability and the controllable behavior show the high potential of these materials for applications such as aerodynamic flow control, automation and architecture. },

In terms of LMIs, a necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the existence of a sliding-mode observer guaranteeing a stable sliding motion on the switching surface that is insensitive to matched uncertainties. The gain matrices of the sliding-mode observer are characterised using the solution of the LMI existence condition.

However, Lorenz' research was mainly based on (non-rigorous) numerical simulations, and, until recently, the proof of the existence of the Lorenz attractor remained elusive. To address that problem some authors introduced geometric Lorenz models and proved that geometric Lorenz models have a strange attractor. In 2002 it was shown that the original Lorenz model behaves like a geometric Lorenz model and thus has a strange attractor.

In this paper we show that geometric Lorenz attractors are computable, as well as show their physical measures.},

The multi-output state estimation problem has been treated by several authors using methods for nonlinear observer design. This paper shows that a perspective system can be transformed to two observer forms, and provides constructive methods for arriving at the transformations. These observer forms lead to straightforward observer designs. First, it is shown that, using an output transformation, the system admits an observer form which leads to an observer with linear error dynamics. A second observer design is based on a time-scaled block triangular form. Both designs assume a commonly used observability condition. The designs are demonstrated in simulation.},

of the unforced zero dynamics of the system and the definition of a concept of
forced zero dynamics. These concepts generalize the notion of transmission zeros
f o r MIMO linear systems in a nonlinear setting. Chemical engineering examples are
given to illustrate the calculation of zero dynamics. Input/output linearization is
then interpreted as canceling the forced zero dynamics of the system, and precise
internal stability conditions are derived f o r the closed-loop system.},

The construction relies on two steps: The construction of a strictly increasing path in a region defined on the positive orthant in ℝn by the gain matrix and the combination of the given ISS Lyapunov functions of the subsystems to a ISS Lyapunov function for the composite system.

Novelties are the explicit path construction and that all the involved Lyapunov functions are nonsmooth, i.e., they are only required to be locally Lipschitz continuous. The existence of a nonsmooth ISS Lyapunov function is qualitatively equivalent to ISS.},

Quasi-static feedback of these generalized states, which involves time derivatives of the closedloop input, is shown to allow control of all flat systems by feedback linearization of the tracking error dynamics. This is then used in a method proposed for the analysis and design by subsystems of certain flat series connections. The results are illustrated on a gantry crane example.},

However, if a linearly controllable system is amenable to quadratic linearization, it is not clear how to derive the transformation leading to quadratic linearization. Our approach to the derivation of necessary and sufficient conditions for quadratic linearization is constructive in nature in the sense that once the conditions are satisfied, the normalizing and input transformations are derived leading to quadratic linearization. We use state feedback to make the system eigenvalues non-resonant allowing the closed-form solution of the generalized homological equations which leads to the transformation solution. The proposed technique is illustrated with an example.},

  Abstract                 = {An inversion procedure is introduced for nonlinear systems which constructs a bounded input trajectory in the preimage of a desired output trajectory. In the case of minimum phase systems, the trajectory produced agrees with that generated by Hirschorn's inverse dynamic system; however, the preimage trajectory is noncausal (rather than unstable) in the nonminimum phase case. In addition, the analysis leads to a simple geometric connection between the unstable manifold of the system zero dynamics and noncausality in the nonminimum phase case. With the addition of stabilizing feedback to the preimage trajectory, asymptotically exact output tracking is achieved. Tracking is demonstrated with a numerical example and compared to the well-known Byrnes-Isidori regulator. Rather than solving a partial differential equation to construct a regulator, the inverse is calculated using a Picard-like interaction. When preactuation is not possible, noncausal inverse trajectories can be truncated resulting in the tracking-error transients found in other control schemes},

The quantifier-elimination (QE) software package \{QEPCAD\} is used to eliminate quantifiers on state and plant parameters, to obtain regions of admissible controller parameters, that guarantee robust stability and performance.},

The scheme employs a Volterra model—a simple and convenient nonlinear extension of the linear convolution model employed by conventional MPC—and gives rise to a controller composed of a conventional linear controller augmented by an auxiliary loop of nonlinear ‘corrections’. Simulation case studies involving two different examples representative of the typical spectrum of nonlinear behavior in real chemical processes—an industrial polymerization reactor and an isothermal reactor exhibiting inverse response—are used to demonstrate the practical utility of the control scheme and to evaluate its performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Extremum seeking feedback is a powerful method to steer a dynamical system to an extremum of a partially or completely unknown map. It often requires advanced system-theoretic tools to understand the qualitative behavior of extremum seeking systems. In this paper, a novel interpretation of extremum seeking is introduced. We show that the trajectories of an extremum seeking system can be approximated by the trajectories of a system which involves certain Lie brackets of the vector fields of the extremum seeking system. It turns out that the Lie bracket system directly reveals the optimizing behavior of the extremum seeking system. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical foundation and prove that uniform asymptotic stability of the Lie bracket system implies practical uniform asymptotic stability of the corresponding extremum seeking system. We use the established results in order to prove local and semi-global practical uniform asymptotic stability of the extrema of a certain map for multi-agent extremum seeking systems.},

Both of the formulas can be used in nonholonomic motion planning. A simple algorithm of motion planning based on the formulas is presented.

  Abstract                 = {The stability-sufficient condition in designing an observer for non-linear Lipschitz systems is extended such that it does not neglect the structure of given non-linearity and can be less conservative in applying to many non-linear systems. A design procedure based on full control problem is then presented to satisfy the extended condition by means of a constant observer gain. Finally, simulation examples are given to exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed condition and design procedure in dealing with some large Lipschitz non-linearities.},

It compares five algorithms, including the linear design, with respect to their ease of design and their closed-loop performance. For all these algorithms local asymptotic stability of the desired equilibrium is ensured. The motivation of the present study is not to illustrate the validity of these theoretical results, but to test their performance when confronted with a real physical application where situations not predicted by the theory will arise. The behavior of the schemes is compared with the following basic criteria: transient and steady state response to steps and sinusoidal references, attenuation of disturbances in the power supply, and sensitivity to unknown loads. Particular emphasis is placed throughout on the flexibility provided by the tuning parameters to shape the responses. Even though this issue is not always appreciated in theoretical studies, we have found it of prime importance in experimentation},

Of particular interest, it is shown that adaptive high gain like observers and adaptive sliding mode like observers can be derived by considering particular expressions of the design function.

  Abstract                 = {The inverse of a non-linear dynamical system is introduced and its synchronization with the original system is discussed. If the original system is chaotic and if despite this the inverse system synchronizes, the two systems can be used respectively as a modulator and a demodulator for a chaotic carrier signal. The transmitted signal is then hidden in chaos. We show that the inverse system can have a different order from the original system. The difference corresponds to the relative degree of the original system. In an inverse system with reduced order it is easier to achieve synchronization; on the other hand, such a system may distort a noisy input signal considerably. Examples from the literature are discussed from the point of view of order reduction. New circuit examples are given where the input and the output are not variables at the same port, as is the case for all published examples in the context of communication with chaotic signals. Finally, a quite general system structure together with its inverse that can be designed for synchronization is given.},

A state transformation puts the system into a linear time-varying form which simplifies observability analysis and allows for an observer design with sufficient conditions for convergence. The proposed design is validated by simulation.},

It is obtained using the theorem of the primitive element from differential algebra. The derivation of the controller form does not apply to multivariable constant linear systems. With the transformations, all nonlinear dynamics can be exactly linearized by dynamic feedback. The main departure from standard theory is that transformations may depend on input derivatives.

Their physical properties are subsumed by a linearizing output and they might be regarded as providing another nonlinear extension of Kalman's controllability. The distance to flatness is measured by a non-negative integer, the defect. We utilize differential algebra where flatness- and defect are best defined without distinguishing between input, state, output and other variables. Many realistic classes of examples are flat. We treat two popular ones: the crane and the car with n trailers, the motion planning of which is obtained via elementary properties of plane curves. The three non-flat examples, the simple, double and variable length pendulums, are borrowed from non-linear physics. A high frequency control strategy is proposed such that the averaged systems become flat.},

The main distinguishing feature of this MATLAB implementation is the separation of the linear combination of derivative vectors into a separate derivative vector class {\tt derivvec}. This allows for the straightforward performance optimisation of the overall package. Additionally by internally using a matrix (two-dimensional) representation of arbitrary dimension directional derivatives we may utilise MATLAB's sparse matrix class to propagate sparse directional derivatives for MATLAB code which uses arbitrary dimension arrays. On several examples the package is shown to be more efficient than Verma's ADMAT package.},

one or more inputs from it. This question is important in the design of robotic systems from the perspective of
trajectory planning and control, specially if they are under-actuated. The goals of this article are as follows:
(i) using counter examples, we first show that feedback linearisability may not be preserved when new inputs are
added to a robotic system, (ii) sufficient conditions are determined when a system will retain this property under
the addition of new inputs. The theory is illustrated through some examples from the robotics field.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to their simple implementation based on a constant gain matrix, high gain observers are very common in practical applications. We consider systems whose dynamics can be decomposed into a linear and a nonlinear part, where the nonlinear part meets some Lipschitz condition. In many cases there exists a finite bound on the maximum feasible Lipschitz constant for which the error dynamics can be stabilized. Necessary and in some sense sufficient conditions for this maximum Lipschitz constant are given in [1]. These results has been improved in [2,3] by taking the structure of the linear part into account.Having a system with one single nonlinearity, the results given in [2,3] are strict. If multiple nonlinearities occur, even this approach tends to be to conservative. In this case, one could additionally take the internal structure of the nonlinearities into account which leads to a larger set of systems for which convergence of the observer error can be guaranteed.Our new approach is based on an approximation of the structured singular value [4] which yields existence conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). These LMIs may as well be used for the numerical computation of the observer gain. We demonstrate the advantage of our method on an example. (© 2016 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this contribution is to introduce a new approach for simulating mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints. The technique of algorithmic differentiation is employed together with Hamel's equations of motion permitting to incorporate the nonholonomic constraints directly instead of generating a system of differential-algebraic equations. To apply the proposed simulation approach, the user only needs to state the kinetic and potential energies, the nonconservative forces, and the nonholonomic constraints of the system to be simulated. The procedure is demonstrated by an illustrating example of a nonholonomic moving robot.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Time-delay naturally appears in many control systems, and it is frequently a source of instability. However, for some systems, the presence of delay can have a stabilizing effect. Therefore, stability and control of time-delay systems is of theoretical and practical importance. Modern control systems usually employ digital technology for controller implementation, i.e. sampled-data control. A time-delay approach to sampled-data control, where the system is modeled as a continuous-time system with the delayed input/output became popular in the networked control systems, where the plant and the controller exchange data via communication network. In the present tutorial, introduction to Lyapunov-based methods for stability of time-delay systems is given together with some advanced results on the topic. },

  Abstract                 = {Der vorliegende Artikel leistet einen Beitrag zur systematischen Untersuchung nichtlinearer Systeme bezüglich Flachheit. Es wird ein Algorithmus vorgeschlagen, der ausgehend von einer Linearisierung um eine beliebige Trajektorie eine sog. unimodulare Vervollständigung der Tangentialsystemmatrix liefert. Um Flachheit schließlich nachzuweisen und einen flachen Ausgang des nichtlinearen Systems zu bestimmen, muss diese Vervollständigung zusätzlich bestimmten Integrabilitätsbedingungen genügen. Unter Zuhilfenahme einer frei verfügbaren Implementierung des Algorithmus wird die systematische Flachheitsuntersuchung am Beispiel des Brückenkrans ausführlich demonstriert. Weiterhin ergeben sich in einigen Fällen erhebliche Vereinfachungen, was beispielhaft am kinematischen Fahrzeugmodell gezeigt wird.

The present article describes an approach that allows a systematic analysis of nonlinear systems regarding flatness. Based on a linearization around an arbitrary trajectory, an algorithm for determining a so-called unimodular completion is proposed. In order to prove flatness and identify a flat output of the nonlinear system, this completion needs to fulfill certain integrability conditions. A freely available implementation of the algorithm is used to determine flat outputs, which is shown in the example of a gantry crane. Furthermore, in some cases, considerable simplifications may occur which is exemplified by the kinematic vehicle.},

However, the difficulty of both verification and identification heavily depends on the representation of the system. This contribution shows that flatness may be a far less complicated matter, depending on the choice of coordinates.},

  Abstract                 = {Differential flatness and methods based on this property have proved to be very fruitful for tracking controllers and trajectory planning of nonlinear systems. As a dual to the concept of differentially flat outputs, this contribution deals with the computation of flat inputs, and thus with the problem of actuator placement. Given a mathematical description of a system's behavior and a desired output, we propose an algorithm that constructs such inputs for observable systems. We show that there are no integrability problems which are typical for flat output computations, and exemplify this by an example. For non-observable systems, we show that an additional constraint needs to be fulfilled. It is not obvious how to incorporate this into an algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {We study the transport and mixing properties of flows in a variety of settings, connecting the classical geometrical approach via invariant manifolds with a probabilistic approach via transfer operators. For non-divergent fluid-like flows, we demonstrate that eigenvectors of numerical transfer operators efficiently decompose the domain into invariant regions. For dissipative chaotic flows such a decomposition into invariant regions does not exist; instead, the transfer operator approach detects almost-invariant sets. We demonstrate numerically that the boundaries of these almost-invariant regions are predominantly comprised of segments of co-dimension 1 invariant manifolds. For a mixing periodically driven fluid-like flow we show that while sets bounded by stable and unstable manifolds are almost-invariant, the transfer operator approach can identify almost-invariant sets with smaller mass leakage. Thus the transport mechanism of lobe dynamics need not correspond to minimal transport. The transfer operator approach is purely probabilistic; it directly determines those regions that minimally mix with their surroundings. The almost-invariant regions are identified via eigenvectors of a transfer operator and are ranked by the corresponding eigenvalues in the order of the sets’ invariance or “leakiness”. While we demonstrate that the almost-invariant sets are often bounded by segments of invariant manifolds, without such a ranking it is not at all clear which intersections of invariant manifolds form the major barriers to mixing. Furthermore, in some cases invariant manifolds do not bound sets of minimal leakage. Our transfer operator constructions are very simple and fast to implement; they require a sample of short trajectories, followed by eigenvector calculations of a sparse matrix.},

  Abstract                 = {An adaptive sideslip angle observer considering tire–road friction adaptation is proposed in this paper. The single-track vehicle model with nonlinear tire characteristics is adopted. The tire parameters can be easily obtained through road test data without using special test rigs. Afterwards, this model is reconstructed and a high-gain observer (HGO) based on input–output linearisation is derived. The observer stability is analysed. Experimental results have confirmed that the HGO has a better computational efficiency with the same accuracy when compared with the extended Kalman filter and the Luenberger observer. Finally, a road friction adaptive algorithm based on vehicle lateral dynamics is proposed and validated through driving simulator data. As long as the tires work in the nonlinear region, the maximal friction coefficient could be estimated. This algorithm has excellent portability and is also suitable for other observers.},

Furthermore, we will give transformations between general DAEs and ones in semi-explicit form, and, by these techniques, show how a problem can be reduced to an index 1, semi-explicit form that can be reduced to an implicit differential equation from whose solution the solution to the original problem can be retrieved by at most a differentiation and a linear transformation.},

  Abstract                 = {Milling is one of the most important cutting procedures in the wood industry. It allows shaping of workpiece surfaces with a high chip-removal rate. This is possible because of a fast rotary cutting motion, the possibility to place many cutting edges on the tool circumference and a fast linear feeding motion. Due to these different kinds of motions the resulting effective motion follows a prolonged cycloid which forms periodic waves on the workpiece surface. These surface patterns, called cuttermarks, may be visible on the machined surface after cutting and mainly influence the workpiece quality. Further surface machining steps are required to meet the demanded standards of surface quality. This is why researchers have been looking for possibilities to lower or avoid these cuttermarks. Beside the description and the analyses of the geometry of cuttermarks, magnitudes of disturbance, mechanical and mechatronic approaches and alternative procedures will be introduced and discussed. Especially mechatronic approaches can improve this situation by basically adjusting the cycloid motion track. In this way, the effective motion of the cutting edge is changed to a nearly linear motion by means of piezo-electric actuators or magnetic bearings. First successful set-up and experiments will be shown.},

This is possible because of a fast rotary cutting motion, the possibility to place many cutting edges on the tool circumference and a fast linear feeding motion. Due to these different kinds of motions the resulting effective motion follows a prolonged cycloid which forms periodic waves on the workpiece surface. These surface patterns, called cuttermarks, may be visible on the machined surface after cutting and mainly influence the workpiece quality. Further surface machining steps are required to meet the demanded standards of surface quality. This is why researchers have been looking for possibilities to lower or avoid these cuttermarks. Beside the description and the analyses of the geometry of cuttermarks, magnitudes of disturbance, mechanical and mechatronic approaches and alternative procedures will be introduced and discussed. 
Especially mechatronic approaches can improve this situation by basically adjusting the cycloid motion track. In this way, the effective motion of the cutting edge is changed to a nearly linear motion by means of piezo-electric actuators or magnetic bearings. First successful set-up and experiments will be shown.},

Design techniques which are based on a stable system inversion result in input trajectories with pre- and/or post-actuation intervals. The presented approach treats the considered transition task as a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) and yields causal feedforward trajectories, which are constant outside the transition interval. The main idea of this approach is to provide free parameters in the desired output trajectory to solve the BVP of the internal dynamics. Thereby, a standard MATLAB function can be used for the numerical solution of the BVP. Feedforward control design techniques are illustrated by simulation results for a simple example.},

  Abstract                 = {Tracking is a very important issue for control and has received considerable treatment in the input affine framework. Unfortunately, many real systems exhibit a behavior which is clearly non input affine. To cope with this, an integral extension of the model can be used to produce an extended input affine system, hiding the input nonlinearity in the drift term of the new model. This approach, however, has several disadvantages. In this paper, we consider a different approach, motivated by physical considerations and practical experiences, which is based on the transformation or approximation of the original system by a cascade of a nonlinear non input affine map and a following input affine nonlinear system. As the paper shows, well known results of tracking control can be easily extended to this class yielding the solution of the original problem. Simulation results are presented to confirm the validity of the proposed techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {Fostered by a growing interest in nonlinear control theory and catalyzed by the discovery in the early 1980s of the exact conditions under which a nonlinear plant can be linearized by static-state feedback and coordinate transformation, in the last decades there has been a rapid increase of interest in the search for approximate solutions to the problem of linearizing nonlinear systems by state or output feedback. Main reason for that is the limited applicability of the rigorous methods, and the complexity, sensitivity and design difficulties of the exact linearizing compensators, if any. In the present paper, the literature on the subject is reviewed and organized in what is believed to be a new and consistent perspective. Recent works, especially in the area of data-based techniques, are in fact described and related, whenever possible, to fundamental results previously obtained by model-based differential geometric methods; this is expected to bring modern system linearization methods closer to the needs of practicing control engineers and to stimulate further research eventually able to fill visible gaps in this direction. },

  Abstract                 = {Feedback linearization is an effective design and analysis tool used in the study of nonlinear control systems. However, cases arise where linearizability conditions cannot be met. For systems that are not linearizable by classical techniques, orbital feedback linearization (or feedback linearization by state-dependent time scaling) has been proposed to relax these conditions. Unfortunately, approaches proposed to date have led to conditions that tend to be more difficult to check then conditions for state-feedback linearization. In this paper, necessary and sufficient conditions for orbital feedback linearizability is presented for a class of single-input nonlinear systems. The conditions are simple and can be checked directly from the data of the problem. Using an exterior calculus approach, a simple algorithm is developed to compute state-dependent time scaling that yield state-feedback linearizable systems. It is shown that orbital feedback linearizability generalizes the concept state-feedback linearizability to deal with locally weakly accessible control systems.},

It extends the results of Fliess and Marquez (2000) to the non-linear case. The mathematical setting, which is valid for multivariable systems, is provided by the theory of flatness-based exact feedforward linearisation introduced by the authors (Hagenmeyer and Delaleau 2003b). Thereby differential flatness does not only yield an easy calculation of the predicted trajectories considering the respective system constraints, but allows to use simple linear feedback parts in a two-degree-of-freedom control structure. Moreover, this formalism permits one to handle non-minimum phase systems, and furthermore to deal with parameter uncertainties and exogenous perturbations. Respective robustness analysis tools are available. Finally, an induction drive example is discussed in detail and experimental results for this fast electro-mechanical system are presented.},

The functions are implemented in NLControl, a package for nonlinear control systems, developed within the computer algebra system Mathematica. The implemented algorithm is quite elaborate. It involves the elements from the exterior differential calculus and from the theory of non-commutative polynomial rings, and requires solving large-scale systems of partial differential equations. At present the developed programs are only able to handle simple systems.},

The controller is designed to provide nominal performance, and a nonlinear filter is added to make the controller implementable and to account for plant/model mismatch. An important advantage of the new approach is that the assumption of full-state feedback inherent in most input-output linearization schemes is eliminated. However, the proposed IMC strategy is restricted to open-loop stable systems with stable inverses. Under mild assumptions, the closed-loop system possesses the same stability, perfect control, and zero offset properties as linear IMC. Simulation results for a continuous fermentor illustrate the advantages of the nonlinear IMC strategy.},

Some of the most promising controller design techniques are based on exact linearization theory. In this paper, exact linearization strategies for process control are critically evaluated. It is shown that many design techniques recently developed for non-linear process control are based, either implicitly or explicitly, on exact linearization of the input-output map. Extensions of basic techniques that are especially pertinent for process control problems are reviewed and evaluated. A thorough survey of applications to process control problems is included. Finally, an input-output linearizing controller is designed for a different process control problem, pH neutralization, and simulation results are presented. This example demonstrates that input-output linearization can be extended to the class of problems where the output equation is an implicit rather than explicit function of the state variables.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with the study of structurally stable properties associated with systems described by one, or several, real analytic vector fields via approximating systems which retain information pertinent to these properties. For example, let $X_0 , \cdots ,X_m $ be real analytic vector fields on an $n$-manifold $M$. An affine control system has the form (i) $\dot x = X_0 (x) + \sum\nolimits_{i - 1}^m {u_i } X_i (x)$; a second-order partial differential equation can be written as (ii) $\sum\nolimits_{i = 1}^m {X_i^2 } v - X_0 v = f$, while if $X_0 (p) = 0$ the asymptotic stability of the rest solution requires analysis of (iii) $\dot x = X_0 (x)$. If, in (ii), $m < n$ yet the vector fields in the Lie algebra generated by $X_1 , \cdots ,X_m $ , when evaluated at $p$, span the tangent space to $M$ at $p$, the operator is hypoelliptic but an approximation of the vector fields needed to describe the singularity in a parametrix must retain more information than a linearization of the vector fields does. Similarly, the question of small time local controllability of (i) has been dealt with by constructing higher-order approximating vector fields which generate a nilpotent Lie algebra. The theory of these high-order approximations and their applications is concisely developed.},

  Abstract                 = {Since unlimited control energy is not available, actuator saturation is probably the most frequent nonlinearity encountered in control applications. Although a reduction of the input amplitude slows down the transient speed, it can have a detrimental effect on the behaviour of the closed loop and it may even cause instability. These effects were first observed in controllers containing integral parts, when the integrator state was "winding up" during input saturation and because of this, the undesired effects of input saturation are now called windup. Input saturation not only causes a mismatch in the controller states (the controller windup) but also a mismatch in the plant states (the plant windup). Though both types of windup have similar effects on the transients of the closed loop, they can clearly be separated from one another and this conceptual differentiation also allows a systematic design of appropriate measures for their prevention. Whereas controller windup is removable by structural modifications when realizing the compensator, the prevention of plant windup calls for additional dynamics. The problem of windup prevention in the presence of stable plants has been a well-researched field for a long time. The solutions presented, however, are based on various interpretations of the windup effects and, consequently, the remedies offered also look quite dissimilar at first sight. At a closer inspection, however, the various approaches can be represented in a unified scheme, with certain parameters adapted to the special approach. The prevention of windup in the presence of unstable systems has not yet reached the same state of maturity. As the prevention of controller windup is not influenced by the location of the plant poles, the difficult problem to solve in open loop unstable systems is the prevention of plant windup. There are numerous papers on constrained control for unstable systems, but most results only apply to special problems and/or require mathematical tools not commonly used by engineers.}

  Abstract                 = {For initial and initial-boundary value problems described by differential equations, stability requires the solutions to behave well for large times. For linear constant-coefficient problems, Fourier and Laplace transforms are used to convert stability problems to questions about roots of polynomials. Many of these questions can be viewed, in a natural way, as quantifier-elimination problems. The Tarski–Seidenberg theorem shows that quantifier-elimination problems are solvable in a finite number of steps. However, the complexity of this algorithm makes it impractical for even the simplest problems. The newer Quantifier Elimination by Partial Algebraic Decomposition (QEPCAD) algorithm is far more practical, allowing the solution of some non-trivial problems. In this paper, we show how to write all common stability problems as quantifier-elimination problems, and develop a set of computer-algebra tools that allows us to find analytic solutions to simple stability problems in a few seconds, and to solve some interesting problems in from a few minutes to a few hours.},

But the conjecture, that the existence of potential energy leads to the existence of smooth feedback does not hold, either. In this paper we give further necessary and sufficient conditions with respect to the Brockett's condition and local controllability, depending on the potential energy of the system. Based on these results system analysis may be simplified and appropriate control methods can be chosen.},

After this analysis, a control method based on the controllability property of the system is suggested. More precisely, we concatenate flows of vector field of the system to generate appropriate constant input values.

The frozen Riccati method uses a non-unique state-dependent linear representation to reduce the HJE to a state-dependent Riccati equation. While there usually exists some choices that recover the optimality, it may be difficult to find. The NLMI computation for analysis and synthesis is shown to be as hard as Lyapunov stability analysis; a finite difference approximation scheme is proposed to solve the NLMIs},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new method with a software tool for parametric robust control synthesis by symbolic-numeric computation. The method is a parameter space approach and it is especially effective for analysis and design of fixed-structure controllers of rational type, which encompass PI and PID controllers. The real quantifier elimination (QE), which is one of the recent progresses in the symbolic computation, plays a key role in our development. The QE-based approach can uniformly deal with a lot of important design specifications for robust control such as frequency restricted H ∞ norm constraints, stability (gain/phase) margin and stability radius specifications, and pole location requirement by reducing such specifications to a particular type of formulae called a ``sign definite condition (SDC)''. This is also useful for improving the efficiency of QE computations since we can utilize an efficient QE algorithm specialized to the SDC using the Sturm-Habicht sequence. We have developed a MATLAB toolbox for robust parametric control based on a parameter space approach accomplished by QE. The QE-based parameter space approach and numerical simulation of performances for specific controller parameter values taken from a controller parameter space are integrated conveniently in our toolbox with the assistance of a graphical user interface (GUI). With our toolbox the feasible regions of controller parameters are visualized in a parameter space for the controllers with three or two parameters. This enables control engineers to achieve multi-objective robust controller synthesis smoothly. We also discuss how to merge the numerical computation and the symbolic operation to make our new design methods more efficient in practical control design.},

to the system is taken into account. This paper proposes a numerically tractable condition to analyze ISS for polynomial
nonlinear systems. The condition is formulated as a sum of squares (SOS) problem that is a feasibility problem including
SOS polynomials. A solution of the problem is obtained by solving a semidefinite programming problem. The key
technique is to formulate class K ∞ functions, which have the inverse map on real nonnegative region, as polynomials.
This paper also gives numerically tractable ISS conditions for the cascade connection of subsystems and for the feedback
interconnected system. A few examples are shown to illustrate our analysis conditions.},

Assuming that the measures of the contact force and the train velocity are both available, we estimate the states by means of a robust nonlinear observer constructed by the incorporation of a robust sliding mode term in the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). Secondly, we use a Feedback Linearization method to transform the original nonlinear plant into its equivalent linear one. The obtained feedback linearized system can be controlled with a large number of linear approaches that can be tuned according to the specification requirements. Using these theoretical elements, we apply a observer-based linear quadratic regulator (LQR) in order to stabilize the system and solve the reference tracking problem. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.},

  Abstract                 = {Precise dynamic models of processes are required for many applications, ranging from control engineering to the natural sciences and economics. Frequently, such precise models cannot be derived using theoretical considerations alone. Therefore, they must be determined experimentally. This book treats the determination of dynamic models based on measurements taken at the process, which is known as system identification or process identification. Both offline and online methods are presented, i.e. methods that post-process the measured data as well as methods that provide models during the measurement. The book is theory-oriented and application-oriented and most methods covered have been used successfully in practical applications for many different processes. Illustrative examples in this book with real measured data range from hydraulic and electric actuators, machine tools, industrial robots, pumps, vehicles to combustion engines. Real experimental data is also provided on the Springer webpage, allowing readers to gather their first experience with the methods presented in this book.

Among others, the book covers the following subjects: determination of the nonparametric frequency response, (fast) Fourier transform, correlation analysis, parameter estimation with a focus on the method of Least Squares and modifications, identification of time-variant processes, identification in closed-loop, identification of continuous time processes, and subspace methods. Some methods for nonlinear system identification are also considered, such as the Extended Kalman filter and neural networks. The different methods are compared by using a real three-mass oscillator process, a model of a drive train. For many identification methods, hints for the practical implementation and application are provided. The book is intended to meet the needs of students and practicing engineers working in research and development, design and manufacturing.}

Both continuous-time and discrete-time systems are considered. A potential advantage over existing parametrization schemes in the frequency domain is that the controller order can be fixed. Consequently, necessary and sufficient conditions for stabilizability via static output feedback controller are obtained and stated by the existence of a quadratic Lyapunov functionV(x):=x T Px such thatP satisfies a linear matrix inequality (LMI), whileP−1 satisfies another LMI. If the controller order is not fixed a priori, then the resulting computational problem can be made convex, and a controller of order less than or equal to the plant order may always be constructed.},

  abstract  = {A magnetic bearing is a bearing which supports the load using magnetic levitation, which could provide 
a contact-less, low frictional losses, lubrication free, high speed operations compared to the conventional bearings. 
The contact forces are generated by actively controlling the dynamics of an electromagnet. An Active Magnetic 
Bearing (AMB) system is inherently nonlinear on account of the nonlinearities of its electromagnetic field, which 
considerably make difficulties in designing efficient and effective system controllers. More over the cost of the AMB 
is obstructing the industry from implementing an AMB. The possible solution is to reduce the number of magnetic 
poles, and hence the three pole AMB system is devised. But it has the major disadvantage of magnetic flux coupling, 
an added nonlinearity. This paper studies the feasibility of an extended systems and sliding mode control scheme 
to design a robust controller to control the nonlinear three pole Active Magnetic Bearing (AMB). The simulation 
analysis is done to quantify the robustness of the proposed controller.},

A recursive technique is proposed which appears to be an extension of the currently popular integrator backstepping idea to the tracking of nonholonomic control systems.

Results on local exponential tracking are also obtained. Two physical examples of an articulated vehicle and a knife edge are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through simulations},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we consider the problem of locally stabilizing non-linear systems by output feedback control. To be precise, the separation principle for non-linear systems are studied, which allows the design of the control law and the observer to be carried out independently. While the previous results assumed the existence of Lyapunov function for the observation error, we assume the existence of a state observer which asymptotically estimates the true state. As a matter of fact, it turns out that the latter condition is necessary for the former condition, but the converse is not true. The separation principle with the reduced order observer is also presented. Under the assumption that a non-linear system has asymptotically stable zero dynamics and is locally detectable, it is shown that the asymptotic output tracking by output feedback control can be achieved.},

However, most systems do not satisfy this condition. To construct sliding-mode observers for systems that do not satisfy the observer matching condition, auxiliary outputs are generated using high-gain approximate differentiators and then employed in the design of sliding-mode observers. The state estimation error of the proposed high-gain approximate differentiator based sliding-mode observer is shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded with respect to a ball whose radius is a function of design parameters. Finally, the unknown input reconstruction using the proposed observer is analyzed and then illustrated with a numerical example. },

When testing for local observability for nonlinear systems, the observability rank condition based on the inverse function theorem is commonly used. However, the rank condition is a sufficient condition, and we cannot test for global observability using the rank condition. In this paper, first we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for global observability at an initial state for continuous-time polynomial systems. Then, necessary and sufficient conditions for local observability are derived from one of the global observability conditions using the localization of a polynomial ring. Using the same procedure, we derive both global and local observability conditions for discrete-time polynomial systems. Each condition is characterized by a finite set of equations, since polynomial rings are Noetherian. Finally, examples demonstrate the proposed criteria for testing for observability.},

The solution to the above system of PDEs is locally analytic and this enables the development of a series solution method, that is easily programmable with the aid of a symbolic software package.},

The elemental systems have representations as novel types of matrix Riccati equations.

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a novel approach for an interval-based gain scheduling control design aiming at a guaranteed stabilization of the system dynamics over a predefined time horizon. Due to the goal of asymptotic stability, the design aims at the temporal reduction of the widths of intervals representing worst-case bounds of the system states at a specific point of time. The main idea of the control approach is the computation of feedback gains for an initial state interval with a subsequent verification step. In this step, it is examined whether the control is valid over a finitely long prediction window. If the verification fails, the gain is adjusted after computing a bounding box of states that are reachable over the complete prediction window. In such a way, controller gains can be calculated off-line so that predefined performance criteria on the closed-loop structure are satisfied. Besides using interval analysis for the underlying reachability analysis, linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques are employed for an efficient solution of the robust and/ or optimal control design. The proposed design method is verified numerically for the control of an inverted pendulum as a prototypical benchmark application.},

Dieser Spezialfall erfordert, dass der flache Ausgang nur von den Konfigurationskoordinaten abhängt, nicht aber von den Geschwindigkeiten und dem Eingang. Zahlreiche Beispiele legen die Hypothese nahe, dass für konservative mechanische Systeme allgemeine Flachheit und Konfigurationsflachheit äquivalent sind. Der vorliegende Beitrag zeigt, dass diese Hypothese zumindest für lineare mechanische Systeme erfüllt ist. Ausgangspunkt sind die Bewegungsgleichungen als rechteckige Polynommatrix zweiter Ordnung.

  Abstract                 = {The concept of differential flatness is an elegant approach to system analysis and the design of controllers and observers. In many cases, however, the main difficulty is the determination of a flat output. For holonomic mechanical systems the notion of “configuration flatness” was introduced some years ago, meaning that a flat output is a function only of configuration variables (and not of the velocities nor the input). Obviously, such a property could drastically facilitate the search for a flat output. In this contribution, we show on the basis of a polynomial matrix representation that for linear conservative mechanical systems left coprimeness (i. e., controllability), which is equivalent to (general) flatness, implies configuration flatness.},

To this end the system is considered in coordinates of the real Jordan normal form, which facilitates the construction of a Control-Lyapunov function. On this basis, a nonlinear feedback law which renders the periodic orbit asymptotically stable is easily derived via Sontags formula.},

Alternatively it may arise from a preceding input-output or input-state linearization. The usual objective for such systems is to stabilize an equilibrium. However, it might as well be interesting to have a stable limit cycle around the equilibrium. So far, limit cycles are often studied in the context of non-smooth dynamics. In contrast, our approach results in a smooth and simple feedback. The first step is to impose a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues to the system while the second one is to construct a bilinear form with which the resulting oscillations can be stabilized at a given amplitude. The applicability of the approach is shown by simulation and experimental results.},

On the one hand it has a very simple structure (second order polynomial, three state components, two affine inputs, no drift) and fulfills the Lie‐Algebra‐Rank‐Condition for (strong) local accessibility. Nevertheless, it has the challenging control property, that it does not admit a continuously differentiable control law, which stabilizes the origin.

In this contribution we consider the system in cylindrical coordinates. If the first time derivatives of the radius and the orientation are chosen as the new inputs, the transformed system dynamics is even simpler (in terms of expression length) than in usual Cartesian form. Moreover, the system can be decomposed into two subsystems and a differentially flat output can be easily read off. Based on this partially decoupled system dynamics we formulate a simple three‐staged control law which drives the system into the origin by aiming for a minimal arc length in the (original) state space.},

In particular the ability to overcome obstacles is in need of improvement. For this using whegs, known from mobile robotics, seems to be promising. But in order to use them for passenger transport purposes, the dynamic height offset occurring in wheg-driven mechanisms, called alternation, strictly has to be eliminated.

  Abstract                 = {Output tracking control of a helicopter model is investigated. The model is derived from Newton-Euler equations by assuming that the helicopter body is rigid. First, we show that for several choices of output variables exact input-output linearization fails to linearize the whole state space and results in having unstable zero dynamics. By neglecting the couplings between moments and forces, we show that the approximated system with dynamic decoupling is full state linearizable by choosing positions and heading as outputs. We prove that bounded tracking is achieved by applying the approximate control. Next, we derive a diffeomorphism showing that an approximation of the system is differentially flat, thus state trajectory and nominal inputs can be generated from a given output trajectory. Simulation results using both output tracking controllers based on exact and approximate input-output linearization are presented for comparison},

Eccentricity control is typically achieved by means of hydraulic actuation.

However, stability concerns interfere the wider adoption of this technology. Motivated by a research project on ancillary services in electrical subtransmission and distribution networks a verification of limits in grid codes was carried out. This paper analyzes the stability of a network with distributed voltage control, which is modeled as an abstract nonlinear multiple input, multiple output system. Applying theoretical stability criterions show that the limits of stability can safely be derived for known parameters of the controlled units. For the more praxis-orientated case without detailed knowledge of the controlled units, a robust small-gain-based stability criterion is presented. Based on this, easy to use rules to ensure the stability of decentralized voltage-controls are derived and verified using simulations in a benchmark grid.},

On the basis of this transformation, an approach for designing control laws for trajectory tracking is presented. The control law is robust in the sense that small changes in it do not produce large steady state errors or loss of stability. The theory provides a unified framework for treating control problems arising in nonlinear chemical processes; this is illustrated by a batch reactor control example.},

The first contribution of this work provides an overview of techniques used for determining which parameters of a model should be estimated. This is a question that commonly arises when fundamental models are used as these models often contain more parameters than can be reliably estimated from data. The decision of which parameters to estimate is independent of the observer/estimator design, however, it is directly affected by the structure of the model as well as the available data. The second contribution is an overview of recent developments regarding the design of nonlinear Luenberger observers, with special emphasis on exact error linearization techniques, but also discussing more general issues, including observer discretization, sampled data observers and the use of delayed measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {A nonlinear system can always be approximated to first order by linear systems. It has been shown by Jakubczyk and Respondek [4] and Hunt and Su [3] that certain nonlinear systems are the exact transforms of linear systems under nonlinear statecoordinatechange and nonlinear statefeedback. In this paper we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a nonlinear system to be approximated to higher order by the transform of a linear system. The use of this technique in the design of nonlinear compensators has been suggested recently by the author [6].},

The significance of the result stems from the fact that constructive solutions to the input-to-state stabilization problem are available (presented in the paper) and that, as shown here, inverse optimal controllers possess margins on input-to-state stability against a certain class of input unmodeled dynamics. Rather than completion of squares, the main tools in our analysis are Legendre-Fenchel transformations and the general form of Young's inequality.},

In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden suboptimale Lösungen des nichtlinearen L2- bzw. H∞-Problems für einen speziellen DC-DC-Konvertertyp, den Cuk-Konverter, angegeben. Da dies das Ermitteln einer positiv definiten Lösung der Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Ungleichung (HJBU) bzw. der Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs-Ungleichung (HJBIU) erfordert, ist es absolut notwendig, sich die physikalische Struktur des Modells zu Nutze zu machen. Dies wird im vorliegenden Fall erreicht, indem eine energiebasierte Beschreibung PWM-getakteter Systeme verwendet wird.

  Abstract                 = {This paper is devoted to the characterization of differentially flat nonlinear systems in implicit representation, after elimination of the input variables, in the differential geometric framework of manifolds of jets of infinite order. We extend the notion of Lie-B{\"a}cklund equivalence, introduced in Fliess et al. (IEEE Trans Automat Contr 44(5):922--937, 1999), to this implicit context and focus attention on Lie-B{\"a}cklund isomorphisms associated to flat systems, called trivializations. They can be locally characterized in terms of polynomial matrices of the indeterminate {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}frac{\{}d{\}}{\{}dt{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$} , whose range is equal to the kernel of the polynomial matrix associated to the implicit variational system. Such polynomial matrices are useful to compute the ideal of differential forms generated by the differentials of all possible trivializations. We introduce the notion of a strongly closed ideal of differential forms, and prove that flatness is equivalent to the strong closedness of the latter ideal, which, in turn, is equivalent to the existence of solutions of the so-called generalized moving frame structure equations. Two sequential procedures to effectively compute flat outputs are deduced and various examples and consequences are presented.},

differential flatness is equivalent to endogeneous dynamic feedback linearizability,

general dynamic feedbacks called regular. We prove in this paper the equivalence

Consequently, the text provides an often-needed bridge between undergraduate-level matrix theory and linear algebra and the level of matrix analysis required for graduate-level study and research. The text is sufficiently compact that the material can be taught comfortably in a one-quarter or one-semester course. Throughout the book, the author emphasizes the concept of matrix factorization to provide a foundation for a later course in numerical linear algebra. The author addresses connections to differential and difference equations as well as to linear system theory and encourages instructors to augment these examples with other applications of their own choosing.},

Piecewise quadratic, possibly discontinuous candidate ISS Lyapunov functions are employed for both analysis and synthesis purposes. This enables us to obtain sufficient conditions based on linear matrix inequalities, which can be solved efficiently. One of the advantages of using the ISS framework is that additive disturbance inputs are explicitly taken into account in the analysis and synthesis procedures. Furthermore, the results apply to PWA systems in their full generality, i.e. non-zero affine terms are allowed in the regions in the partition whose closure contains the origin.},

Sufficient conditions for the existence of exact linearising inputs are derived. Exact tracking solutions of a number of example systems, including the ball and beam system studied by Hauser et al. (1992), are analysed. It is shown that linearising inputs may be: 1) highly non-unique, 2) discontinuous and include impulses, and 3) fragile. A framework is established for approximate linearisation. whereby exact linearising inputs are formulated as the limits of sequences of realisable, arbitrarily accurate linearising inputs. This framework is constructive in nature and of key importance when the exact linearising inputs are, for example, unrealisable},

In this paper, we attempt to investigate the ultimate bound and positively invariant set for two specific systems, the Lorenz system and a unified chaotic system. We derive an ellipsoidal estimate of the ultimate bound and positively invariant set for the Lorenz system, for all the positive values of its parameters a, b and c, and obtain the minimum value of volume for the ellipsoid. Comparing with the best results in the current literature [D. Li, J. Lu, X. Wu, G. Chen, Estimating the bounds for the Lorenz family of chaotic systems, Chaos Solitons Fractals 23 (2005) 529–534; X. Liao, On the global basin of attraction and positively invariant set for the Lorenz chaotic system and its application in chaos control and synchronization, Sci. China Ser. E 34 (2004) 1404–1419], our new results fill up the gap of the estimate for the cases of 0<a<1 and 0<b<2 [X. Liao, On the global basin of attraction and positively invariant set for the Lorenz chaotic system and its application in chaos control and synchronization, Sci. China Ser. E 34 (2004) 1404–1419]. Furthermore, the estimation derived here contains the results given in [D. Li, J. Lu, X. Wu, G. Chen, Estimating the bounds for the Lorenz family of chaotic systems, Chaos Solitons Fractals 23 (2005) 529–534] and [X.

Along the same line, we also provide estimates of cylindrical and ellipsoidal bounds for a unified chaotic system, for its parameter range 0⩽α<129, and obtain the minimum value of volume for the ellipsoid. The estimate is more accurate than and also extends the result of [D. Li, J. Lu, X. Wu, G.

  Abstract                 = {Constructing a family of generalized Lyapunov functions, a new method is proposed to obtain new global attractive set and positive invariant set of the Lorenz chaotic system. The method we proposed greatly simplifies the complex proofs of the two famous estimations presented by the Russian scholar Leonov. Our uniform formula can derive a series of the new estimations. Employing the idea of intersection in set theory, we extract a new Leonov formula-like estimation from the family of the estimations. With our method and the new estimation, one can confirm that there are no equilibrium, periodic solutions, almost periodic motions, wandering motions or other chaotic attractors outside the global attractive set. The Lorenz butterfly-like singular attractors are located in the global attractive set only. This result is applied to the chaos control and chaos synchronization. Some feedback control laws are obtained to guarantee that all the trajectories of the Lorenz systems track a periodic solution, or globally stabilize an unstable (or locally stable but not globally asymptotically stable) equilibrium. Further, some new global exponential chaos synchronization results are presented. Our new method and the new results are expected to be applied in real secure communication systems.},

In this paper we show the existence of linear state feedback and/or output feedback control laws for semi-global exponential stabilization rather than global asymptotic stabilization of such systems. We explicitly construct linear static state feedback laws and/or linear dynamic output feedback laws that semi-globally exponentially stabilize the given system. Our results complement the “negative result” of Fuller (1977) and Sussmann and Yang (1991).},

dynamics existing in Boost type DC/DC converter when using
capacitor voltage as output, there is a great limitation on its
performance, such as low-bandwidth and sluggish dynamic
response. This paper, based on input-output feedback
linearization, proposes a novel scheme of nonlinear control
strategy. This strategy can not only solve the nonlinearity and
unstable zero-dynamics problems in direct method when taking
capacitor voltage as output, but also overcome the lack duo to
power source fluctuation and load variation in indirect technique
when taking inductor current as output. Its effectiveness is
experimentally validated by means of a self-manufactured
prototype. Experimental results show that, compared with
traditional PI cascade control strategy, excellent results such as
extensive range of output voltage regulation, good performance
in dynamic and steady-state can be available in Boost type
DC/DC converter.},

This paper investigates the structural characteristics of linear time-invariant descriptor systems and develops an efficient technique for converting a descriptor system to recursive form, if such a conversion is possible. The paper exploits the connection between descriptor systems and the classical theory of matrix pencils. This yields a canonical form for descriptor systems. The main contribution of the paper is the shuffle algorithm. This algorithm serves both as a test for the solvability of a descriptor system, and as a procedure for converting a system to recursive form, without a change of variable.},

  Abstract                 = {Often in control design it is necessary to construct estimates of state variables which are not available by direct measurement. If a system is linear, its state vector can be approximately reconstructed by building an observer which is itself a linear system driven by the available outputs and inputs of the original system. The state vector of annth order system withmindependent outputs can be reconstructed with an observer of ordern-m. In this paper it is shown that the design of an observer for a system withMoutputs can be reduced to the design ofmseparate observers for single-output subsystems. This result is a consequence of a special canonical form developed in the paper for multiple-output systems. In the special case of reconstruction of a single linear functional of the unknown state vector, it is shown that a great reduction in observer complexity is often possible. Finally, the application of observers to control design is investigated. It is shown that an observer's estimate of the system state vector can be used in place of the actual state vector in linear or nonlinear feedback designs without loss of stability.},

In many practical situations only a few output quantities are available. Application of theories which assume that the state vector is known is severely limited in these cases. In this paper it is shown that the state vector of a linear system can be reconstructed from observations of the system inputs and outputs. It is shown that the observer, which reconstructs the state vector, is itself a linear system whose complexity decreases as the number of output quantities available increases. The observer may be incorporated in the control of a system which does not have its state vector available for measurement. The observer supplies the state vector, but at the expense of adding poles to the over-all system.},

Unfortunately, the existence of a solution to the GCE is not a generic property. For unforced, scalar-output systems, we show how spline functions may be used to construct approximate solutions that minimize a norm of the non-linear terms obstructing linearization of the error dynamics. The resulting error dynamics are shown to be locally exponentially stable. A numerical example illustrates the design and performance of the observer.},

The main advantage of this nonlinear controller is that there is no restriction on the size of the signal variations around the operating point. Small as well as large signal variations around the operating point are considered. Sliding mode controllers for buck, boost, buck-boost, and Cuk power converters have been designed and discussed. These controllers have been simulated on a digital computer and their dynamic performances have been shown to be satisfactory. Finally, Lyapunov's second theorem has been used to verify the stability of the designed sliding mode controller for the Cuk power converter},

The concepts of nonlinear coordinate transformation, Lie derivative, and relative degree are used to design the observer for power systems. In this proposed design framework, the both cases are considered-when the relative degree of a nonlinear system is equal to the order of the system and when the relative degree is not equal to the order of the system. The nonlinear observer gain is calculated from the Jacobian of nonlinear coordinate transformation. The main advantages of this design technique is the simplicity to construct the unmeasured states and applications to other fields. The proposed observer is simulated on a single machine infinite bus (SMIB) system to construct all the states of power system and a comparison between the actual states and observed states is also presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Flat systems, an important subclass of nonlinear control systems introduced via differential-algebraic methods, are defined in a differential geometric framework. We utilize the infinite dimensional geometry developed by Vinogradov and coworkers: a control system is a diffiety, or more precisely, an ordinary diffiety, i.e. a smooth infinite-dimensional manifold equipped with a privileged vector field. After recalling the definition of a Lie-Backlund mapping, we say that two systems are equivalent if they are related by a Lie-Backlund isomorphism. Flat systems are those systems which are equivalent to a controllable linear one. The interest of such an abstract setting relies mainly on the fact that the above system equivalence is interpreted in terms of endogenous dynamic feedback. The presentation is as elementary as possible and illustrated by the VTOL aircraft.},

  Abstract                 = {A detailed analysis is given of the geometric structure of a chaotic attractor observed from an extremely simple autonomous electrical circuit. It is third order, reciprocal, and has only one nonlinear element: a 3-segment piecewise-linear resistor. Extensive laboratory measurements from this circuit and a detailed geometrical analysis and computer simulation reveal the following rather intricate "anatomy" of the associated strange attractor. In addition to a microscopically infinite sheet-like composition the attractor has a macroscopic "double-scroll" structure, i.e., two sheetlike objects are curled up together into spiral forms with infinitely many rotations. (See frontispiece.) The chaotic nature of this circuit is further confirmed by calculating its associated Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov dimension. The double-scroll attractor has one positive, one zero and one negative Lyapunov exponent. The Lyapunov dimension turns out to be a fractal between 2 and 3 which agrees with the observed structures. The power spectra of the three associated state variables obtained by both measurement and computer simulation show a continuous broad spectrum typical of chaotic systems.

This second order sliding modes algorithm is widely used to design controllers, observers and exact differentiators. The proposed Lyapunov functions ascertain finite time convergence, provide an estimate of the convergence time, and ensure the robustness of the finite-time or ultimate boundedness for a class of perturbations wider than the classical ones for this algorithm. Since the Lyapunov functions and their derivatives are quadratic forms, the operation with them is as simple as for linear time invariant systems.},

For the problem of perspective observability necessary and sufficient conditions are known, which are hard to verify. For the class of systems studied in this paper the testing can be essentially simplified. Instead of the infinite number of parameters originally necessary, we propose a finite number of selected parameters that are sufficient for the test. This makes the criterion applicable in practice. Furthermore we show possibilities for numerically stable algorithms to test for perspective observability.},

The computational effectiveness of this method is demonstrated in controlling the excitation to optimise the performance of a synchronous machine simulated as a simple 3rd-order system. The results presented in this paper show that the application of quasilinearisation technique gives an accurate solution utilising considerably less computer time compared with the more commonly used gradient method. However, the core requirements for this method are greater than those for the gradient method. To examine the effects of the relative emphasis placed on the different state variables in the performance criterion, optimisation has been carried out with respect to two different quadratic indices. The usefulness of the quasilinearisation technique is further demonstrated by its application to an optimisation problem with practical constraints on the control variable.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces new and fast ways of systematically calculating the limiting values of the parameters of PID-action controllers for systems that are open-loop stable, or unstable, minimum phase, or non-minimum phase, and can contain explicit time-delay terms. The technique presented, which is based on the axis-crossing form of Nyquist's stability theorem, can be readily used for the design of PID controllers to meet certain closed-loop stability and performance requirements. A summary of the background development is given and it is then shown how, by using a simple feature available in most symbolic algebra environments, a much faster version of the proposed method, which avoids the need to calculate any Nyquist diagrams, can be obtained for systems with no explicit time-delay term. A recent complete analytical solution to the PID compensator that results in a very significant reduction in the computing time, yielding almost real-time results, is also introduced. The methods proposed can be extended to develop robust controllers for systems with uncertainties, and present a visual characterization of all PID controllers meeting the desired performance criteria for such systems. Other time-domain performance requirements such as the Integral of Time and Absolute Error criterion can also be employed to select an optimal operating point from the allowable set of controller parameters. An application of these tools to the fan-speed control of the Pegasus aircraft gas-turbine engine, used in the Harrier jump-jet, will be presented.},

We show that for non-affine nonlinear systems there may not exist a continuous control law which would keep the output identically equal to zero and for which the zero output constrained dynamics are stable, whereas a discontinuous controller which achieves this exists. We give conditions for existence and present a method for design of discontinuous switching controllers which yield stable zero dynamics. In this sense, the results of this paper enlarge the class of non-affine nonlinear systems that can be termed minimum-phase},

  Abstract                 = {Recent work on the structure of social networks and the internet has focussed attention on graphs with distributions of vertex degree that are significantly different from the Poisson degree distributions which have been widely studied in the past. In this paper we develop in detail the theory of random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions. In addition to simple undirected, unipartite graphs, we examine the properties of directed and bipartite graphs. Among other results, we derive exact expressions for the position of the phase transition at which a giant component first forms, the mean component size, the size of the giant component if there is one, the mean number of vertices a certain distance away from a randomly chosen vertex, and the average vertex-vertex distance within a graph. We also apply our theory to some real-world graphs, including the world-wide web and collaboration graphs of scientists and business-people. We demonstrate that in some cases random graphs with appropriate distributions of vertex degree predict with surprising accuracy the behavior of the real world, while in others there is a measurable discrepancy between theory and reality, perhaps indicating the presence of additional social structure in the network which is not captured by the random graph. },

The design problem considered is to determine a robust controller so as to ensure that, despite plant uncertainties, the error and the controller output stay within prescribed bounds for all time and for all inputs whose magnitude and whose slope satisfy given bounding conditions. In essence, the backlash is replaced with a constant gain and a bounded disturbance, thereby resulting in an auxiliary uncertain linear system. Then, by applying the multi-valued version of the fixed-point theorem and the extended version of the theory of majorants, we derive a practical condition in the form of inequalities that can be solved in practice. Further we show that if such inequalities are satisfied for a chosen nominal system, then the original design problem is solved. The usefulness of the method is illustrated by a design example where the plant has a time-delay.},

The original design inequalities are replaced with the surrogate design criteria that are in keeping with the method of inequalities.

Systems which are differentially flat have several useful properties which can be exploited to generate effective control strategies for nonlinear systems. The original definition of flatness was given in the context of differential algebra, and required that all mappings be meromorphic functions. Our formulation of flatness does not require any algebraic structure and allows one to use tools from exterior differential systems to help characterize differentially flat systems. In particular, we show that in the case of single input control systems (i.e., codimension 2 Pfaffian systems), a system is differentially flat if and only if it is feedback linearizable via static state feedback. However, in higher codimensions feedback linearizability and flatness are not equivalent: one must be careful with the role of time as well the use of prolongations which may not be realizable as dynamic feedbacks in a control setting. Applications of differential flatness to nonlinear control systems and open questions are also discussed},

Zero dynamics in flat systems occur when the flat outputs are not the tracking outputs. This means that the output trajectories can be fully parametrized by the flat outputs, but that there is some additional freedom left. This freedom can be exploited to minimize a cost criterion. We parametrize the differentially flat outputs by basis functions, and solve for the parameters so as to track a prescribed trajectory approximately while minimizing a cost function.

The obtained results generalize and elucidate already known results about systemsdot{x} = A(x) - sum min{i=1}max{m} =u_{i}B_{i}(x). A new and direct differential geometric interpretation of the concept of controlled invariance and the derived conditions is given.},

  Abstract                 = {This article deals with a new approach to particulate process control. The model system under investigation, the continuous fluidized bed spray granulation with external product classification, is described by a nonlinear partial integro-differential equation, the population balance equation for the particle size distribution. This process exhibits interesting dynamical behavior, i.e. a change of the stability behavior and the occurrence of limit cycles. In addition, the zero dynamics with respect to moment measurements frequently used in practice are unstable in certain parameter regions. In order to stabilize these types of systems in this contribution the use of a generalized distance measure, the discrepancy, is proposed. Applying, the associated stability theory, i.e. stability theory with respect to two discrepancies, a stabilizing control law can be derived. One of the main advantages of the proposed discrepancy based control method is that no model reduction is required.}

Whether or not this additional requirement actually imposes extra constraints on the initial Values depends on the particular problem. This paper derives a criterion for determining whether differentiation of a subset of the equations of a nonlinear DAE system provides further constraints to be satisfied by the initial values. A graph-theoretical algorithm is proposed to locate those subsets of the system equations which need to be differentiated.

Many applications work with a finite set of the possible state space. In case the nonlinear system is not entirely observable on a given state space the local observability is provided by the algorithm. The necessary observability matrix is calculated through computing Lie derivatives directly by using power series. The nonlinear system is examined to that effect that the states are distinguishable for an observer. The indistinguishable sets are checked whether the observability matrix is full rank. Finally, the capability of the introduced algorithm is illustrated by means of two examples.},

  abstract  = {This note is concerned with the static output feedback (SOF) H-infinity controller design for linear time-invariant systems. A sufficient bilinear matrix inequality (BMI) condition is developed for finding a stabilizing static output feedback H-infinity controller. For the first time, a novel cone complementary linearization approach within the context of linear matrix inequalities (LMI) is proposed to investigate the feasibility of the stabilizing controller synthesis along with a minimized H-infinity attenuation rate. The proposed method requires neither any apriori assumption generally made on the input/output matrices nor any application of a coordinate transformation. An example is presented for the application of the proposed scheme.},

This approach uses closed-form expressions of cause/effect pairs that make possible an arbitrarily smooth transition between two given output set-points. The cause/effect pairs are based on the introduced concept of transition polynomials. Simple optimization procedures are then proposed to solve the relevant optimal output synthesis and optimal input synthesis. The potentiality of the method is highlighted by the examples presented, namely, a synthesis of elevator velocity profiles and the performance improving of a \{PID\} controller.

This approach is based on a new control architecture where the main purpose of the feedback is to reduce the sensitivity to parametric plant uncertainties permitting in such a way the effective use of a feedforward action determined via a stable dynamic inversion. Essential constituents of the architecture are a parameterized family of “transition” polynomials to shape ideal output transfers and a parameterized controller ensuring the internal model principle. The methodology is then centered on the optimal combined design of the feedback controller and of the inversion-based command signal in order to minimize the worst-case settling time subject to an amplitude constraint on the control variable and to arbitrarily assigned overshoot and undershoot bounds. Finally, an approximate or suboptimal solution to the resulting nonlinear optimization problem can be obtained by genetic algorithms. A worked example highlights the effectiveness of the overall methodology},

  Abstract                 = {In the following we present an analytic methodology for the analysis of singularly perturbed harmonic oscillators. Therefore, we combine geometric methods with the theory of singularly perturbed systems, which we use as tool for reduced order modeling. Through this procedure, we are able to model the steady state oscillation as well as the start-up behavior of sinusoidal oscillators. Moreover, we will show that singularly perturbed harmonic oscillators are of particular importance for different technical fields, especially the modeling of high dimensional electrical oscillators. Furthermore, we demonstrate our technique by means of the 4th order Clapp Oscillator},

By this transformation, the system is decomposed into two subsystems. The first subsystem can be linearized by feedback, and the second subsystem does not directly depend on the input. To achieve this structure, the last components of the transformation have to fulfill a partial differential equation. Practically, the appropriate choice of these coordinates is usually left to the (experienced) user. In this note, the author suggests a direct calculation based on the computation of flows of certain vector fields.},

  Abstract                 = {High gain observer design can be carried out for nonlinear systems, whose dynamics can be decomposed into a linear and a Lipschitz continuous nonlinear part. The observer uses a linear output injection, which is specified by a constant gain matrix. Due to this simple structure, high gain observers are frequently used in practical applications. The observer gain is often chosen via eigenvalue placement. However, the formal existence conditions are more complicated. In many cases, there is a finite bound on the maximum feasible Lipschitz constant of the nonlinear part for which the error dynamics can be stabilized. The existing results can be improved significantly, if the structure of the linear part is taken into account.},

  Abstract                 = {Peripheral milling is an important cutting procedure to shape work pieces of wood. Because of the kinematical principle there are so-called cutter-marks on the surface of the work pieces after cutting which influence the quality. These surface patterns cannot be avoided completely and most of the time there are some efforts to smooth the surface by sanding or linear cutting afterwards which cost extra time and money. To improve this situation a new mechatronic approach is introduced to eliminate the cycloid motion track when the cutting edge approaches the work piece. In this way, the effective motion of the cutting edge is changed to a linear motion by means of piezo actuators or magnetic bearings.},

  Abstract                 = {If a nonlinear system is differentially flat and a flat output is known, the design of a linearizing feedback law is straightforward. For state-space systems, this corresponds to the input-to-state linearization. Otherwise, i.e., if the system is not flat or no flat output can be found, we could carry out an input-output linearization provided the system is minimum phase. In this case, only certain parts of the systems dynamics are assigned by the control law. From a theoretical point of view, this method is based on the Byrnes-Isidori normal form. A less common approach is the usage of the non-flat output in order to carry out a linearization in connection with the generalized controller canonical form Fliess 1990. The linearization is achieved by a dynamic extension. The existence of an alternative linearization method may be advantageous from a computational point of view and gives additional degrees of freedom, e.g. allowing for a higher-order of the desired closed-loop dynamics. Both approaches are illustrated on the nonlinear boost converter model.},

In this contribution, we treat the single-input case, where input-to-state linearizability is equivalent to flatness. Sufficient and necessary existence conditions are well-known, but quite restrictive. We propose the design of a tracking controller for flat single-input systems, where the explicit knowledge of the flat output is not required. Our approach is based on a series expansion of the tracking error along a given reference trajectory. The controller gain can even be computed for non-flat systems with regular controllability matrix.},

For a single-input system, exact linearizability if equivalent to flatness. Unfortunately, the existence conditions are quite restrictive. Even if the existence conditions are met, the explizit computation of the flat output can be very difficult. In this contribution we suggest tracking controllers based on the tangent system, where the flat output is not required explizitly. The controller can even be calculated for controllable non-flat systems.},

Based on the relationship between determinantal divisors of a pencil and spanning-cycle families of the associated digraph G(E, A), the Jordan-block-size structure is determined graph-theoretically. For classes of structurally equivalent matrix pencils defined by a pair of structure matrices [E, A], the generic Jordan block sizes corresponding to the characteristic roots at zero and at infinity can be obtained from the unweighted digraph G([E], [A]). Eigenvalues of matrices are discussed as special cases. A nontrivial mechanical example illustrates the procedure.},

Nonlinear observability is based on the concept of indistinguishability, for which we examine the observability map regarding to injectivity. To carry out the analysis we use a computation technique called quantifier elimination. Our approach can be applied even if the observability analysis requires more components of the observability map than the dimension of the state space. The observability analysis is illustrated on several example systems.

  Abstract                 = {In mechatronics and robotics one often encounters highly complex nonlinear systems, whose dynamics are described by a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. In simulation, one can use very sophisticated models, whereas controllers are typically designed on strongly simplified models. Quite often, this results in linear controllers which are unsuitable for the original nonlinear system. We suggest an approach allowing nonlinear controller design even for very complicated models. Our approach is based on an alternative differentiation method called algorithmic or automatic differentiation. With this computation method we can circumvent problems that may arise in symbolic computation.},

The method presented allows us to determine if such a system is configuration flat and, if so, provides a constructive method for finding all possible configuration flat outputs. Our characterization relates configuration flatness to Riemannian geometry. We illustrate the method with two examples.},

  Abstract                 = {Control strategies for nonlinear dynamical systems often make use of special system properties, which are, for example, differential flatness or exact input-output as well as input-to-state linearizability. However, approaches using these properties are unavoidably limited to specific classes of mathematical models. To generalize design procedures and to account for parameter uncertainties as well as modeling errors, an interval arithmetic approach for verified simulation of continuous-time dynamical system models is extended. These extensions are the synthesis, sensitivity analysis, and optimization of open-loop and closed-loop controllers. In addition to the calculation of guaranteed enclosures of the sets of all reachable states, interval arithmetic routines have been developed which verify the controllability and observability of the states of uncertain dynamic systems. Furthermore, they assure asymptotic stability of controlled systems for all possible operating conditions. Based on these results, techniques for trajectory planning can be developed which determine reference signals for linear and nonlinear controllers. For that purpose, limitations of the control variables are taken into account as further constraints. Due to the use of interval techniques, issues of the functionality, robustness, and safety of dynamic systems can be treated in a unified design approach. The presented algorithms are demonstrated for a nonlinear uncertain model of biological wastewater treatment plants.},

  Abstract                 = {The control design for many practical applications involves a need to specifically treat parameter uncertainty and disturbances. As shown in previous work of the authors, techniques from interval analysis can be used for this purpose in an efficient way. The two options that have been considered so far are the use of interval analysis in either a framework for model predictive control or in a framework for variable-structure sliding mode design. In the latter case, interval techniques can be used efficiently for a robust stabilization of continuous-time dynamic systems despite bounded uncertainty. To avoid unnecessarily conservative control strategies, it has to be shown in real time that the closed-loop control system is guaranteed to remain asymptotically stable despite bounded error variables. This online stability proof is performed on the basis of suitable candidates for Lyapunov functions, whereas functionalities for interval analysis are provided by C++ software libraries. Required partial derivatives, for transformations of state equations into suitable canonical forms and for the estimation of a finite number of time derivatives of the controlled variables, are efficiently computed by algorithmic differentiation. This paper presents an overview of interval-based variable-structure control approaches for the thermal behavior of solid oxide fuel cells. These approaches consist of trajectory tracking during nonstationary heating phases and disturbance compensation at high-temperature operating points. Finally, they rigorously account for state and actuator constraints.},

Durch Nutzung von Ergebnissen aus der algebraischen Geometrie können Bedingungen für beliebige Polzuweisbarkeit abgeleitet werden. Alle zulässigen statischen Rückführungen lassen sich als Punkte in einer Grassmannschen Mannigfaltigkeit in einem projektiven Raum deuten. Unter der Annahme, dass das Produkt der Anzahl der skalaren Ein- und Ausgänge größer als die dynamische Ordnung des Systems ist, werden eine notwendige und eine hinreichende Bedingung für die beliebige Polzuweisbarkeit formuliert und bewiesen. Die Verfasser stellen ein Verfahren zur numerischen Ermittlung einer konstanten Ausgangsrückführmatrix vor, die die gewünschte Polplatzierung bewirkt. Anhand eines nicht-trivialen Beispiels werden die Rechenschritte des Verfahrens im Detail illustriert.},

Die Deskriptorgleichungen werden als Berechnungsabläufe interpretiert und im Berechnungsgraphen veranschaulicht. Mit Hilfe des Berechnungsgraphen und des zugehörigen Ableitungsgraphen lassen sich wichtige Charakteristiken bei linearen Deskriptorsystemen graphentheoretisch deuten und durch Inspektion der Graphen ermitteln. Ableseregeln für die Dimension des langsamen Teilsystems, die Anzahl und die Größe der Jordan-Blöcke des schnellen Teilsystems und für die strukturellen Steuerbarkeitsmerkmale werden formuliert. Anhand der graphentheoretischen Bestimmung des relativen Grades wird gezeigt, daß Berechnungsgraphen an Kombination mit den Ableitungsgraphen auch für die Analyse nichtlinearer dynamischer Systeme nützlich sind.},

  Abstract                 = {The main result of the paper states that almost any analytic single-input control system, which is truly nonlinear, that is not feedback linearizable, with controllable linearization at an equilibrium point, does not admit any symmetry preserving that point. By almost any system, we mean that we exclude a small class of odd systems, that admit just one nontrivial symmetry conjugated to minus identity. The obtained results are based on a recent classification of nonlinear single-input systems under formal feedback. We also describe symmetries of feedback linearizable systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Second-order sliding mode control synthesis is developed for underactuated mechanical systems, operating under uncertainty conditions. In order to locally stabilize an underactuated system around an unstable equilibrium, an output is specified in such a way that the corresponding zero dynamics is locally asymptotically stable. Then, the desired stability property of the closed-loop system is provided by applying a quasihomogeneous second-order sliding mode controller, driving the system to the zero dynamics manifold in finite time. Although the present synthesis exhibits an infinite number of switches on a finite time interval, it does not rely on the generation of first-order sliding modes, while providing robustness features similar to those possessed by their standard sliding mode counterparts. A second-order sliding mode appears on the zero dynamics manifold which is of co-dimension greater than the control space dimension. Performance issues of the proposed synthesis are illustrated in numerical and experimental studies of a cart–pendulum system. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The limitations of the state-space approach in circuit modelling have led to semistate formulations, currently framed within the context of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). Stability results for these DAE models can be stated in terms of matrix pencils, avoiding the need for state-space reductions which are not advisable in actual circuit simulation problems. The stability results here presented are applied to electrical circuits containing non-linear devices such as Josephson junctions or MOS transistors.}

  Abstract                 = {The problems of invariant tracking and invariant stabilization are considered: Design a state feedback for tracking or stabilization, respectively, such that the closed-loop dynamics is invariant under the action of a given group. Errors are then defined as invariants of the group under consideration. The approach is illustrated on two classical examples: the non-holonomic car and a continuous stirred chemical reactor. In both cases the differential flatness of the models allows for a systematic design of feedback laws for invariant tracking. The feedback synthesis is simplified by using implicit system descriptions.},

  Abstract                 = {Flat non-linear systems are linearizable by quasi-static feedback of generalized states. As a consequence, stable tracking of reference trajectories can be achieved with controllers which do not introduce extra dynamics into the loop. If, moreover, the system has a series structure, this may be exploited for simplifying the flatness-based analysis and design. The resulting method is illustrated on a series connection of two chemical reactors. Flatness-based analysis of the stationary solution and using these results the design of reference trajectories which account for constraints are discussed in detail. Quasi-static feedback controllers are designed and some simulations are reported.},

  Abstract                 = {Slip between the ground and wheel often cannot be avoided in most applications of mobile robots. However, a majority of controllers developed so far make a no-slip assumption with non-holonomic constraints. To achieve desired performance in the presence of slip, controllers that are robust to slip are required. In this paper, we discuss robust trajectory-tracking control for a differentially driven two-wheeled mobile robot. The structure of a differential flatness controller, which has shown distinctive advantages providing an integrated framework for planning and control, is extended to account for slip disturbances. It is shown that the differential flatness framework can be extended to develop a robust controller based on a dynamic as well as a kinematic model with slip. Simulation results for both kinematic and dynamic controllers are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the robust controllers. Experiments with the kinematic controller which is suited to typical laboratory and field mobile robots were conducted to validate the proposed robust controller. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed robust controllers are effective in the presence of slip.},

In general, most of the schemes used to control the three-phase voltage source inverter (3?-VSI) assume the exact full state information provided by a set of sensors. However, from a practical point of view, it results in exploring the possibility of reducing the number of sensors, or even using these soft sensors as redundants for security purposes. On the basis of some structural properties of the converter, we show mathematically that is possible to design such estimators for two particular cases even in the presence of singular inputs. In this light, we propose two nonlinear observers: a sliding mode observer and a Kalman-like estimator. Finally, the performance of these soft sensors are investigated by simulations in a control-loop which is based on the dead-beat space vector modulation technique},

Employing the phase plane analysis and a singular perturbation approach to split the dynamics into slow and fast ones, we construct analytically the Poincaré map of the solution to the piecewise-linear equations. We investigate conditions for the occurrence of synchronized oscillations of in phase as well as of antiphase in terms of parameters representing the strength of the synaptic coupling and the decaying relaxation rate of the synaptic dynamics. We present the results of numerical simulations that agree with our theoretical ones.},

An enormous variety of nonlinear differential equations and functions have been recast exactly in the canonical form called an 
S-system. This is a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, each with the same structure: the change in a variable is equal to a difference of products of power-law functions. We review the development of S-systems, prove that the minimum for the range of equations that can be recast as S-systems consists of all equations composed of elementary functions and nested elementary functions of elementary functions, give a detailed example of the recasting process, and discuss the theoretical and practical implications. Among the latter is the ability to solve numerically nonlinear ordinary differential equations in their S-system form significantly faster than in their original form through utilization of a specially designed algorithm.},

Diese Dreiecksform wird sukzessive durch entsprechende Koordinatentransformationen erzeugt, welche das System in Teilsysteme aufspaltet. Ziel ist es nun, aus einem Teilsystem alle Systemgrößen, die nicht als Ableitungsvariablen auftauchen, auszurechnen, unter der Prämisse, dass eine Lösung des anderen Teilsystems bekannt ist. Durch Wiederholung dieser Vorgehensweise gelangt man schließlich zur gewünschten Dreiecksform.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel Lyapunov stability based method for the parameter space design of linear time invariant control systems is proposed in this paper. The basic idea lies in utilizing the Lyapunov equation as the basic vehicle for mapping the stability bounds into the control parameter space. In comparison to the existing parameter space methods in the literature, the new technique provides two computationally critical advantages. First, it avoids the necessity for the frequency gridding which has been almost traditional and a source of an inherent computational complexity. Second, the proposed design method provides directly the bounds in the multi-dimensional control parameter space, thereby dropping the limitation of most related design techniques that take place on a parameter plane. The usage of the proposed method is demonstrated in the prominent case study of a PID control.},

  Abstract                 = {In measurement science and engineering, the method of compensation plays a decisive role and is widely used in practical applications, in particular for sensors and measurement systems, where high accuracy is required. However, a general theoretical system description of this method with particular respect to figures of merit in sensor technology does not exist yet. Nevertheless, this is important for a real understanding of the system's structure and its properties and would facilitate prospective sensor design. Within this work, we provide a general system-based description and comparison of both the compensation and the deflection method. Based on a general sensor model and selected transfer functions, which cover most sensor types, important sensor properties like static deviations in sensitivity, long-term drift effects, response time, output signal characteristics as well as nonlinearities and hysteresis are studied in a systematic fashion for both measurement methods. In the case of a compensation method, the core sensor element is part of a controlled closed-loop system, leading to different system properties compared to an open-loop sensor operated in deflection method. The influence of linear standard controllers, which are widely used in industrial measurement and control systems, is studied with respect to the sensor properties. In the conclusions we will summarize which controller type is appropriate for the attainment of a specifically targeted sensor behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {High product standards and cost-efficient robust process designs are key issues in the pharmaceutical industry and require thorough system understanding of the underlying physical phenomena. Model-based approaches have been proven favorable to gain valuable system insights. However, qualitative inferences can be drawn only if the model is adequately derived and validated by-at best-optimally designed experiments. In this paper, we present a new model inversion strategy to solve model-based design of experiments (MBDoE) problems for model selection; i.e., we maximize the difference of competing model candidates by using the differential flatness concept. Differentially flat systems can represent their states and controls analytically by the so-called flat output and its derivatives. By maximizing the difference of the flat outputs of all considered model candidates, we efficiently obtain analytical model-revealing control actions for the MBDoE problem. When these optimized control actions are implemented, the resulting experimental data are expected to invalidate incorrect models more reliably. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MBDoE concept with potential model candidates that describe different realizations of a mass action reaction system.},

Basic is the notion of a "(C,A,B)-pair of subspaces." This concept is newly defined here, and we give its simplest application (to the problem of disturbance decoupling by observation feedback). We then formulate a general compensator synthesis principle and show how several well-known synthesis techniques can be derived from it. We also show that "almost all" compensators can be interpreted as observer-based compensators, and discuss the relation between the compensator problem and the stable cover problem.},

Das Buch behandelt die theoretischen Grundlagen der Rotordynamik, des elektromagnetischen Kreises und der Regelungstechnik, die zum Verständnis der elektromagnetischen Lagerung notwendig sind. Beispiele von experimentellen Ausführungen und praktischen Anwendungen von Magnetlagern in Labor und Industrie verknüpfen die Theorie mit der Praxis. Ziel des Buches ist es, grundlegende Kenntnisse über den Aufbau und die Komponenten eines Magnetlagersystems zu vermitteln und damit die Fähigkeit, ein elektromagnetisches Lager zu beurteilen, es bei einer rotordynamischen Aufgabe in der Konstruktion oder der Entwicklung einzusetzen oder im Betrieb damit umzugehen.}

  Abstract                 = {Popular trajectory planning techniques for systems with many state variables and complicated constraints are the Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT) framework and its extension RRT*. However, both algorithms heavily depend on the availability of a Local Planner that can cope with the system's dynamics and constraints. We describe a local planning technique for a wide range of orbitally flat systems, i.e. differentially flat systems with time scaling. Although differential equations appear in their descriptions, these systems can be handled by the RRT* with only very little overhead compared to differentially flat ones. We show that solving the differential equations can be avoided during most invocations of the local planner without resorting to approximations. The approach is applied to the task of 3D-trajectory planning for a fixed-wing aircraft and planning results are compared to a previous implementation that did use approximations.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a trajectory planning method for fixed-wing aircraft based on the RRT* randomized planning framework. Our main contribution is a trajectory segment design technique that relies on the differential flatness property of the system model. This enables fast analytical evaluation of state and input trajectories. To simplify the integration with an underlying trajectory tracking controller, adjacent trajectory segments are designed to be C(exp 2) continuous, which translates into at least C(exp 0) continuity for all relevant system variables. In simulation experiments, real-time performance is achieved for typical application scenarios on hardware equivalent to decent mobile computing units.},

  Abstract                 = {Using the state-space average modeling method, a nonlinear affine model of Boost converter working on current conduction mode (CCM) is set up. Based on the input-output linearization method of differential geometry theory, the internal dynamics of the systems, with output represented by the input inductor current and the capacitor voltage respectively, are been studied. It is pointed out that the average PWM model of the dasiaBoostpsila converter, with output represented by the average capacitor voltage, is actually a nonminimum phase system, and its internal dynamics is unstable. So, it is unfeasible to control the output voltage directly. But, if the output is represented by the average inductor current, the system is a minimum phase system, and its internal dynamics is asymptotically stable. It is feasible to control the output voltage indirect through the regulation of inductor current. Further, the nonlinear state feedback law is proposed. The control law proposed in this paper has some advantages of being simple, easy to implement. The validity of the indirect output capacitor voltage control scheme using input-output feedback linearization method is verified by numerical simulation results. Key waveforms based on simulated extensive work verify the superiority of the proposed nonlinear control method.},

Systems of this type have been referred to as implicit systems and more recently as descriptor systems since they arise from formulating system equations in physical variables. Special cases of such systems are algebraic-differential systems. We discuss the numerical advantages of this formulation and identify a class of numerical integration algorithms which have accuracy and stability properties appropriate to descriptor systems and which preserve structure, detect nonsolvable systems, resolve initial value consistency problems, and are applicable to "stiff" descriptor systems. We also present an algorithm for the control of the local truncation error on only the state variables.

  Abstract                 = {A major barrier to the widespread use of AD is that current systems make AD difficult to use in a modular and convenient fashion. For instance, modularity and programmer convenience would seem to require that the author of a minimisation routine be able to use AD internally without exposing its use to the caller. Moreover, a routine that uses AD internally should be useable within a routine that will itself be processed via AD, and this should be allowed without any extra caveats. Supporting this sort of nested and modular use of AD requires viewing AD in terms of the mathematical and practical frameworks of programming language theory. Doing so reveals a difficult issue: variable capture. Solving this issue opens the door to the construction of AD systems that allow nested use of AD operators that interact orthogonally with other language constructs, and moreover expresses the AD operators in a fashion that makes them amenable to a variety of aggressive program optimisation techniques developed over the last two decades. After briefly introducing these issues, we will describe how AD operators can be incorporated as first-class citizens in an augmented lambda-calculus, which is the mathematical formalism in which programming language semantics are expressed. We will then exhibit a system that embodies this work and therefore allows free modular nested use of the AD operators, and show how it allows previously problematic constructs to be naturally expressed.},

  Abstract                 = {Chemical processes with input multiplicity behavior place a limitation on the structure of the feedback controller. Systems with right-half-plane zeroes (characteristic inverse response) also pose inherent feedback performance limitations. In this paper we prove that systems with input multiplicity must, under some assumptions, have right-half-plane zeroes on one âsideâ of the steady-state operating curve. A discrete dynamic model of a system with input multiplicity is shown to exhibit nonminimum-phase behavior. Stabilizing tuning parameters (prediction horizon and weighting on the inputs) for unconstrained nonlinear predictive control of nonlinear processes are found using the convergence theory of iterative processes. Closed-loop regions of attraction are constructed using a numerical Lyapunov function. Stabilization using nonlinear predictive control and significance of the closed-loop region of attraction are demonstrated on the isothermal Van de Vusse reaction and on the classic irreversible adiabatic CSTR.},

  Abstract                 = {Fitting of non-Gaussian hierarchical random effects models by approximate maximum likelihood can be made automatic to the same extent that Bayesian model fitting can be automated by the program BUGS. The word &#8220;automatic&#8221; means that the technical details of computation are made transparent to the user. This is achieved by combining a technique from computer science known as &#8220;automatic differentiation&#8221; with the Laplace approximation for calculating the marginal likelihood. Automatic differentiation, which should not be confused with symbolic differentiation, is mostly unknown to statisticians, and hence basic ideas and results are reviewed. The computational performance of the approach is compared to that of existing mixed-model software on a suite of datasets selected from the mixed-model literature.},

  Abstract                 = {To make input-output feedback linearization a practical and systematic design methodology for single-input nonlinear systems, two problems need to be addressed. One is to handle systematically the difficulties associated with the internal dynamics or zero-dynamics when the relative degree is less than the system order. The other is to account for the effect of model uncertainties in the successive differentiations of the output of interest. While the first problem has recently received considerable attention, the second has been largely unexplored. This paper represents a preliminary study of a systematic methodology to account robustly for parametric uncertainties in the original system model. The approach is based on combining sliding control ideas with the recursive construction of a closed-loop Lyapunov function, and is illustrated with a simple example.},

  Abstract                 = {A methodology of feedback control is developed to achieve accurate tracking in a. class of non-linear, time-varying systems in the presence of disturbances and para meter variations. The methodology uses in its idealized form piecewise continuous feedback control, resulting in the state trajectory sliding along a time-varying sliding surface in the state space. This idealized control law achieves perfect tracking; however, non-idealities in its implementation result in the generation of an undesirable high-frequency component in the state trajectory. To rectify this, it is shown how continuous control laws may be used to approximate the discontinuous control law to obtain robust tracking to within a prescribed accuracy without generating undesirable high-frequency signal. The method is applied to the control of a two-link manipulator handling variable loads in a flexible manufacturing system environment.},

Specifically it considers the work of Warner in 1975, Joss in 1976 and Kedem in 1977. The conclusions reached in this discussion are that the work by Joss is the best in terms of improvement. The author proceeds to describe how Joss' work can be improved in terms of speed, accuracy and space. A package, Jake, is described which is a compiler that takes a Fortran 66 input definition of a function. This input is limited in that only one subroutine can be specified, and that certain Fortran 66 statements are disallowed. Jake is instructed on how to perform its task by directives within the subroutine. Timing results are provided on the performance of the code produced by Jake over those where finite differencing is used.},

  Abstract                 = {Underactuated mechanical systems are those possessing fewer actuators than degrees of freedom. Examples of such systems abound, including flexible joint and flexible link robots, space robots, mobile robots, and robot models that include actuator dynamics and rigid body dynamics together. Complex internal dynamics, nonholonomic behavior, and lack of feedback linearizability are often exhibited by such systems, making the class a rich one from a control standpoint. In this article the author studies a particular underactuated system known as the Acrobot: a two-degree-of-freedom planar robot with a single actuator. The author considers the so-called swing up control problem using the method of partial feedback linearization. The author gives conditions under which the response of either degree of freedom may be globally decoupled from the response of the other and linearized. This result can be used as a starting point to design swing up control algorithms. Analysis of the resulting zero dynamics as well as analysis of the energy of the system provides an understanding of the swing up algorithms. Simulation results are presented showing the swing up motion resulting from partial feedback linearization designs},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we introduce the Reaction Wheel Pendulum, a novel mechanical system consisting of a physical pendulum with a rotating bob. This system has several attractive features both from a pedagogical standpoint and from a research standpoint. From a pedagogical standpoint, the dynamics are the simplest among the various pendulum experiments available so that the system can be introduced to students earlier in their education. At the same time, the system is nonlinear and underactuated so that it can be used as a benchmark experiment to study recent advanced methodologies in nonlinear control, such as feedback linearization, passivity methods, backstepping and hybrid control. In this paper we discuss two control approaches for the problems of swingup and balance, namely, feedback linearization and passivity based control. We first show that the system is locally feedback linearizable by a local diffeomorphism in state space and nonlinear feedback. We compare the feedback linearization control with a linear pole-placement control for the problem of balancing the pendulum about the inverted position. For the swingup problem we discuss an energy approach based on collocated partial feedback linearization, and passivity of the resulting zero dynamics. A hybrid/switching control strategy is used to switch between the swingup and the balance control. Experimental results are presented. },

  Abstract                 = {This textbook comprehensively introduces students and researchers to the application of continuous symmetries and their Lie algebras to ordinary and partial differential equations. Covering all the modern techniques in detail, it relates applications to cutting-edge research fields such as Yang Mills theory and string theory. Aimed at readers in applied mathematics and physics rather than pure mathematics, the material is ideally suited to students and researchers whose main interest lies in finding solutions to differential equations and invariants of maps. A large number of worked examples and challenging exercises help readers to work independently of teachers, and by including SymbolicC++ implementations of the techniques in each chapter, the book takes full advantage of the advancements in algebraic computation. Twelve new sections have been added in this edition, including: Haar measure, Sato's theory and sigma functions, universal algebra, anti-self dual Yang Mills equation, and discrete Painleve equations.}

bounds including the important result that the decision problem
for Tarski Algebra is bounded from below by a double exponential
function. Soon after, Weispfenning’s group began to implement
substitution techniques in software in order to study their poten-
tial applicability to real world problems. Today virtual substitution
has become an established computational tool, which greatly com-
plements cylindrical algebraic decomposition. There are powerful
implementations and applications with a current focus on satisfia-
bility modulo theory solving and qualitative analysis of biological

In particular, this provides counterexamples to a number of recently published stabilization theorems. It is established, by means of examples, that a minimum-phase system in normal form need not be semiglobally stabilizable or small-input semiglobally BIBO stabilizable, even if the zero dynamics is exponentially stable and the completeness condition holds},

Using these conditions, the inverse problem is solved, wherein given a trajectory γ of the extended system, one must find trajectories of the original system that converge to γ. This is done by means of a universal construction that only involves knowledge of the coefficients of the extended system. These results can be applied to solve the problem of approximate tracking for a controllable system without drift},

We also propose a canonical form and a dual canonical form and show that two systems are equivalent via a formal feedback if and only if their canonical forms (resp., their dual canonical forms) coincide. We give an explicit construction of transformations bringing the system to its normal, dual normal, canonical, and dual canonical forms.

Although nonlinear electronic oscillators are one of the most essential subcircuits in electronic systems typical design concepts for these oscillators are based on ideas of linear circuits. Because the functionality of oscillators depends on nonlinearities, advanced design methods are developed where nonlinearities are an integral part. Since low voltage oscillator concepts have to be developed in modern IC technologies there is a need to include at least thermal noise aspects into the design flow. For this reason we developed new physical descriptions of thermal noise in electronic oscillators where we use ideas from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics as well as the Langevin approach. We illustrate our concepts by some examples.},

The main idea is to derive a criterion which allows to decide if two initial states of a system can be distinguished by the output of the system. This well known criterion is equivalent to an infinite set of nonlinear equations. If the system is globally observable this set of equations has a very special solution set which can be characterized algebraically. Based on results from commutative algebra some new algorithmic methods to describe the solution set are given. This allows a global observability analysis for polynomial systems and for some specific classes of nonlinear systems. The new method is applied to an example from the literature.},

Shankar Sastry, Chair This dissertation addresses the problem of motion planning for systems with velocity constraints which restrict the system velocities but do not reduce the reachable configuration space. Such constraints are nonholonomic. Traditional motion planning methods assume that a robot can move in any direction. These plans cannot be followed by nonholonomic systems, such as car-like mobile robots which cannot move sideways. The theory of exterior differential (particularly Pfaffian) systems is presented as an analysis method for nonholonomic systems. The Goursat normal form for Pfaffian systems of codimension two is shown to be equivalent to the two-input chained form for nonholonomic control systems. Since the N-trailer system satisfies the conditions for conversion in...},

To demonstrate the approach, it is applied to the determination of the bifurcation curves in the parameters' space of Chua's circuit with cubic nonlinearity, and to the study of the dynamics of the limit cycle of a Colpitts oscillator.

This paper proposes a procedure to control an uncertain discrete-time networked system using an aperiodic stabilizing input information. The system is primarily affected by the time-varying, norm bounded, mismatched parametric uncertainty. Aperiodic exchange of information is done due to bandwidth constraint of the communication network. An eventtriggered based robust control strategy is adopted to reduce the effects of system uncertainty in such bandwidth constrained networks. In event-triggered control, the control input is computed and actuated at the system end only when a pre-specified event condition is violated. The robust control input is derived to stabilize the uncertain system by solving an optimal control problem based on a virtual nominal dynamics and a modified costfunctional. It is shown that the robust control law with aperiodic information ensures input-to-state stability (ISS) of the original system in the presence of mismatched uncertainty. Deriving the event-triggering condition for a discrete-time uncertain system and ensuring the stability of such system analytically are the key contributions of this paper. A numerical example is given to prove the efficacy of the proposed event-based control algorithm over the conventional periodic one.},

Es wird eine Softwareumgebung präsentiert, die die aufwändige Auswertung der Kriterien unterstützt.

Differential flatness of linear and nonlinear control systems is a property that simplifies strongly the controller design. Checking differential flatness of nonlinear multi-input systems is still a widely open problem. This contribution discusses the necessary and sufficient conditions for differential flatness, recently introduced by Jean Lévine. These are also valid for nonlinear multi-input systems. A software tool is presented, which supports the complex evaluation of the conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {A new method to extend the classical parameter space approach to switching systems is presented by using a Lyapunov stability mapping method. This extension is a enhancement to the classical approach which is only applicable to low order LTI systems. Moreover, this method has several advantages over the existing parameter space approaches. Currently, the calculation of the root boundaries relies on parameter gridding as well as frequency sweeping. The proposed method avoids this practice while reducing the computational complexity and increasing the practicality at the same time. The proposed procedure handles systems with arbitrary switching which is still a very problematic system class. To avoid the conservatism which comes along with the Lyapunov based method, an numerical algorithm is proposed. This algorithm optimises the estimation of the stability region. The suitability of the procedures is demonstrated on three benchmark examples.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract We extend the notion of flat inputs, which we previously introduced in the SISO case, towards non-linear MIMO systems. For MIMO systems, we have to distinguish two cases for differential flatness, corresponding to feedback-linearizability either by a static or a quasi-static feedback. For the first case, the construction of flat inputs can be solved easily by means of the observability codistribution and indices. The second case remains an open problem, and we illustrate with an example that flat inputs can even be constructed for non-observable systems. In addition, we also discuss the problem of realizing flat inputs as physical actuators in mechanical systems. Copyright © 2010 IFAC.},

This approach can be seen as dual to the search for a flat output of a control system with given input. Our results provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a flat input in the SISO case, which also allows to construct of the vector field associated to the flat input. In addition, a relation between the flat input vector field and non-linear observer design is discussed. A population model is used to illustrate the construction of a flat input.},

Since this procedure starts with the general network equations which are derived by Kirchhoff's law, it can be used for a variety of circuits. The proposed procedure is applied for oscillator and RF mixer circuits which are a crucial part of every wireless communication system. Based on the general network equations, a transformation into equivalent polynomial differential equations is performed using the not widely known method of Kerner. This polynomial differential equation is further transformed into an equivalent infinite-dimensional system of linear differential equations. Since the infinite-dimensional linear system cannot be solved in general, an approximation by a finite one is performed using a self-consistent technique. The obtained finite linear system is used for the approximation of the infinite-dimensional linear system on a predefined interval. The approximation is utilized for the design and analysis process of the circuit, which is a challenging problem until now.},

  Abstract                 = {This contribution deals with the implementation of a nonlinear state observer (often referred to as smart sensor, soft sensor or virtual sensor) for the reconstruction of not directly measured system quantities in the Czochralski crystal growth process. These quantities are required in automatic control systems used to ensure proper crystal growth. The implementation of the observer on the limited computer hardware available at the growth plants is a challenging task because of the complexity of the underlying mathematical model and the necessity to deal with high order partial and total derivatives of the system equations. Using the method of algorithmic differentiation an efficient way is proposed to implement such an observer. The straightforwardness of the approach is illustrated step by step and experimental results are given.},

Current available control algorithms for nonlinear processes rely implicitly or explicitly on an inverse of the process. Linear control methods for nonminimum-phase processes are based on a decomposition of the process into a minimum-phase and a nonminimum-phase part. Such a decomposition is an open problem for nonlinear systems.In this work, a control structure called the minimum-phase output predictor for nonlinear, nonminimum-phase processes is developed. The structure is based on the notion of statically equivalent outputs; a minimum-phase, statically equivalent output is estimated on-line and then an available nonlinear control algorithm is used to control it to set point. The advantage of the proposed formulation is that it is based on the calculation of an output function, not on a decomposition of the process dynamics. The proposed control methodology is applied and its performance is evaluated for a chemical engineering example.},

However, this I/O linearization algorithm requires the control with stable inversion and state feedback. In the present study, a stable inversion technique for nonminimum-phase systems is developed under appropriate assumptions, which includes several steps such as finding the bounded control and bounded state trajectories for tracking the desired signal. In this design, the output tracking error as well as the effect of measurable disturbances can be asymptotically eliminated through generating a feedforward control. Finally, the proposed control methodology is applied to a chemical process, viz. a Van de Vusse reaction in an isothermal or adiabatic stirred-tank reactor, and its performance is evaluated.},

The traditional approach to such systems is to separate the state equations from the algebraic equations. However, such algorithms usually destroy the natural, physically-based sparsity and structure of the original system. Therefore, we consider descriptor systems in their original form. Such systems possess numerous properties not shared by the well-known state variable systems. First, we relate classical theories of matrix pencils to the solvability of descriptor systems. Then we extend the concepts of reachability, controllability, and observability of state variable systems to descriptor systems, and describe the set of reachable states for descriptor systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, the trend of control engineering changes from classical control theory to modern control theory, and also analogue to digital with times. But, even now parameter adjustment in generator excitation control has been often carried out by the classical loop-shaping method using a Bode diagram. Modern control theory has seldom been used in practice due to the facts that the experience of using such design methods is insufficient and there are no introduction results in actual design situations. However, the classical loop-shaping method has some drawbacks, e.g., sensitivity adjustment procedure by a Bode diagram is complicated and cumbersome. In this paper we employ a loop-shaping method using Hinfin norm constraints, which is achieved via a parameter space approach accomplished by symbolic method called quantifier elimination (QE) and apply it to design PI control type AVR of the excitation control. The method allows us to determine appropriate parameter values of PI controller for visually in a parameter space. We report some simulation results for the PI control type AVR design and inspect the performance.},

Schließlich werden von C. I. Byrnes und A. Isidori Systeme mit einer asymptotisch stabilen Nulldynamik als minimalphasig bezeichnet. Wegen der nicht konsistenten Definitionen wird dafür plädiert, den Minimalphasigkeits-Begriff in der Regelungstechnik zu vermeiden und die Stabilität von Filtern und der Nulldynamik mit den wohl definierten Kriterien von Hurwitz oder Ljapunow zu beschreiben.},

The plant is assumed to be a feedback linearizable and minimum-phase system. Firstly, an ideal implicit feedback linearization control (IFLC) is established using implicit function theory. Then a HONN is applied to construct this IFLC to realize approximate linearization. The proposed controller ensures that the closed-loop system is Lyapunov stable and that the tracking error converges to a small neighbourhood of the origin. The requirements of an off-line training phase and the persistant excitation condition are eliminated. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller and the theoretical discussion.},

Especially linearization techniques are frequently employed to design nonlinear controllers. Here we focuse on the input/output linearization which is based on the Byrnes/Isidori normal form. In practice this design method poses a problem. After state feedback the nonlinear system decouples into a stable linear system and a nonlinear part which is neither controllable nor observable. In this paper a nonlinear controller is designed for the model of a helicopter rack. The problem of unstable zero dynamics is adressed and a way to overcome the problem associated with the practical application of the Byrnes/Isidori normal form is shown for this model.},

  Abstract                 = { The prime objective of the paper is to overcome the conventional restriction to the field of rational functions as far as the algebraic design of control systems is concerned. By adopting the affine parameterization approach from algebraic control synthesis for the controllers given as the so-called RQ-meromorphic functions an algebraic solution to time-delay system control design is opened where neither an introduction of 2D transfer functions nor the assumption of commensurate delays is needed. The proposed design results in controllers combining both the integrators and delayers due to this property referred to as anisochronic. },

It is a powerful educational resource for students, engineers, and managers, written by a leading team of robotics experts." - Yukio Hasegawa, Professor Emeritus, Waseda University, Japan. "The Second Edition of the Handbook of Industrial Robotics organizes and systematizes the current expertise of industrial robotics and its forthcoming capabilities. These efforts are critical to solve the underlying problems of industry. This continuation is a source of power. I believe this Handbook will stimulate those who are concerned with industrial robots, and motivate them to be great contributors to the progress of industrial robotics." -Hiroshi Okuda, President, Toyota Motor Corporation. "This Handbook describes very well the available and emerging robotics capabilities.
It is a most comprehensive guide, including valuable information for both the providers and consumers of creative robotics applications." -Donald A. Vincent, Executive Vice President, Robotic Industries Association 120 leading experts from twelve countries have participated in creating this Second Edition of the Handbook of Industrial Robotics. Of its 66 chapters, 33 are new, covering important new topics in the theory, design, control, and applications of robotics. Other key features include a larger glossary of robotics terminology with over 800 terms and a CD-ROM that vividly conveys the colorful motions and intelligence of robotics. With contributions from the most prominent names in robotics worldwide, the Handbook remains the essential resource on all aspects of this complex subject.}

The coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system may be obtained with the aid of cycle families in this graph. Based on this result, a criterion for the existence of fixed modes is derived. The multiplicities of fixed modes may also be determined graph-theoretically. The consequences of structural constraints on the output feedback pattern become evident. Decentralized feedback is discussed as a special case. },

  abstract     = {Mechanical rigid body systems typically are modeled by a system of coupled second order nonlinear differential equations, where the right hand side describes the effect of the system's input, i. e., the external generalized forces. The components of the input are assigned to the scalar differential equations via a matrix which in general depends on the configuration. On the other hand, in the literature predominates the assumption that a separated coordinate representation exists such that a decomposition of the equations of motion into a non-actuated and a fully actuated subsystem is possible. This decomposition disburdens the systems analysis and the controller design but the conditions of its existence have not yet obtained much attention. The present contribution proposes a criterion, whether or not such a choice of separated coordinates is possible. The criterion is an application of the famous Frobenius theorem and will be discussed both in differential form and in vector field formulation. Its application is shown by three simple examples.},

In order to overcome this problem and render the internal dynamics asymptotically stable a parallel compensator can be deployed. This technique has successfully been applied in previous works to linear systems. In this contribution a method to stabilize nonlinear non-minimum phase systems by a combination of parallel compensation and feedback linearization is proposed.

  abstract  = {Despite a large popularity of flatness based methods for nonlinear open and closed loop control, fundamental questions have not been answered and remain open. One of the most elementary of these questions is a systematic computation of flat outputs. Motivated by the problem of actuator placement the dual concept of flat inputs has been introduced which have then shown to be useful quantities for the control of non-flat systems regardless of physical realization as pure computational quantities. For observable systems flat inputs can be derived algebraically, but it has been shown that they exist for (certain) non-observable systems as well. The computation in the general non-observable case, however, remains an open problem. In this contribution we propose a control method based on flat inputs by combining two existing SISO approaches, generalizing it to the MIMO case and circumventing some of its drawbacks, in particular the unsolved flat input computation for non-observable systems. Our method can then be applied to nonlinear non-observable non-flat MIMO systems with stable internal dynamics. We illustrate this approach by an academic example. },

These algorithms follow from substantial theoretical advances on PID stabilization that have been reported. They display the rich mathematical structure underlying the topology of PID stabilizing sets. By presenting these algorithms without the highly technical details of the underlying theory, the paper seeks to make the results accessible to as wide an engineering audience as possible. Examples are presented throughout the paper to clarify the steps involved in implementing the different algorithms. We believe that these algorithms can significantly complement the techniques for industrial PID design, many of which are adhoc in nature. In particular, the graphical displays of feasible design regions using 2-D and 3-D graphics should appeal to control designers and are very suitable for computer-aided design where several performance objectives have to be overlaid and intersected. Specific design problems where these algorithms can be profitably used are discussed.},

  abstract = {We consider the design problem for a Marx generator electrical network, a pulsed power generator. We show that the components design can be conveniently cast as a structured real eigenvalue assignment with significantly lower dimension than the state size of the Marx circuit. Then we present two possible approaches to determine its solutions. A first symbolic approach consists in the use of Gröbner basis representations, which allows us to compute all the (finitely many) solutions. A second approach is based on convexification of a nonconvex optimization problem with polynomial constraints. We also comment on the conjecture that for any number of stages the problem has finitely many solutions, which is a necessary assumption for the proposed methods to converge. We regard the proof of this conjecture as an interesting challenge of general interest in the real algebraic geometry field.},

  year     = {2019},
  abstract = {The method of quantifier elimination constitutes an interesting rather recent computational method in computer algebra implemented in few computer algebra systems. Here we apply this method to the determination of sharp enclosures of the two real roots (when there exist such roots) of the classical parametric quadratic equation (in its complete form with three parameters) with one interval coefficient, which is here an interval parameter, whereas the remaining two coefficients are crisp (deterministic) parameters. The powerful computer algebra system Mathematica is used in all the present computations. The classical closed-form formulae for the above two roots are not required in the present quantifier-elimination-based approach: only the original quadratic equation is employed during quantifier elimination. All three cases of parametric coefficients in the quadratic equation are studied in detail and sharp enclosures of its roots are derived in parametric forms. The present results are also verified by using minimization and maximization commands directly on the closed-form formulae for these two roots. Several numerical applications now with numerical (instead of parametric) intervals for the interval coefficient are also made. The present results are seen to be in complete agreement with previous related original results by Elishakoff and Daphnis, who appropriately used classical interval analysis and based their results on the classical closed-form formulae for these roots. Finally, the enclosures of the roots derived by the present approach are always sharp without any possibility of overestimation contrary to what happens in the classical interval-analysis-based approach, where overestimation may be present in some cases.},

It can be seen as the interface between the real world of applications and the mathematical world of control theory and model abstractions. As such, it is an ubiquitous necessity for successful applications. System identification is a very large topic, with different techniques that depend on the character of the models to be estimated: linear, nonlinear, hybrid, nonparametric, etc. At the same time, the area can be characterized by a small number of leading principles, e.g. to look for sustainable descriptions by proper decisions in the triangle of model complexity, information contents in the data, and effective validation. The area has many facets and there are many approaches and methods. A tutorial or a survey in a few pages is not quite possible. Instead, this presentation aims at giving an overview of the “science” side, i.e. basic principles and results and at pointing to open problem areas in the practical, “art”, side of how to approach and solve a real problem.},

Without any claim for completeness, such applications and methodologies range from enclosing the effect of round-off errors in highly accurate numerical computations over simulating guaranteed enclosures of all reachable states of a dynamic system model with bounded uncertainty in parameters and initial conditions, to the solution of global optimization tasks. By exploiting the fundamental enclosure properties of interval analysis, this paper aims at computing invariant sets of nonlinear closed-loop control systems. For that purpose, Lyapunov-like functions and interval analysis are combined in a novel manner. To demonstrate the proposed techniques for enclosing invariant sets, the systems examined in this paper are controlled via sliding mode techniques with subsequently enclosing the invariant sets by an interval based set inversion technique. The applied methods for the control synthesis make use of a suitably chosen Gr&ouml;bner basis, which is employed to solve B&eacute;zout&rsquo;s identity. Illustrating simulation results conclude this paper to visualize the novel combination of sliding mode control with an interval based computation of invariant sets.},

  abstract = {Eddy currents can significantly hamper the electromagnetic dynamics, especially those of nonlaminated actuators, and have thus been of great interest in actuator control for many years. Although there are high-fidelity models describing phenomena inside the solid core, such as the magnetic skin effect, these models have never been applied directly within the control circuit. The main reason for this is the lack of an appropriate approximation suitable for time-discrete digital implementation on a microcontroller. This article aims to provide a complete review about possible approaches to obtain a rational approximation of the frequency-dependent effective reluctance and inductance of an electromagnetic actuator. The rational approximation is then used to design a common infinite impulse response filter (IIR-filter). Using the example of a flux-controlled magnetic thrust bearing, we conclude with two novel approximations: a mathematically complex Padé approximation of a sum of continued fractions and a simple Matsuda approximation of an implicit equivalent fractional-order system. On the other hand, the former is the most accurate, and the latter allows wider approximation bandwidths. Depending on possible sampling and switching frequencies as well as the bandwidth of the actuator and computing capacity of the control unit, the most appropriate approximation for almost any use case can be selected.},

Reinforcement learning and adaptive dynamic programming techniques are employed to compute an approximated optimal controller using input/partial-state data despite unknown system dynamics and unmeasurable disturbance. Rigorous stability analysis shows that the proposed controller exponentially stabilizes the closed-loop system and the output of the plant asymptotically tracks the given reference signal. Simulation results on a LCL coupled inverter-based distributed generation system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

We showed that the robust controller depends significantly on the modeling of the uncertainty. The performance of the proposed controller is compared with a classical one through experimental analysis. Experimental results show that the proposed controller has a better performance as it reduces the overshoot and provide robustness to uncertainty. Due to the robust design, the controller also has a wide operating range, which is advantageous for practical applications.},

    abstract = { Stochastic bifurcation of a Duffing system subject to a combination of a deterministic harmonic excitation and a white noise excitation is studied in detail by the generalized cell mapping method using digraph. It is found that under certain conditions there exist two stable invariant sets in the phase space, associated with the randomly perturbed steady-state motions, which may be called stochastic attractors. Each attractor owns its attractive basin, and the attractive basins are separated by boundaries. Along with attractors there also exists an unstable invariant set, which might be called a stochastic saddle as well, and stochastic bifurcation always occurs when a stochastic attractor collides with a stochastic saddle. As an alternative definition, stochastic bifurcation may be defined as a sudden change in character of a stochastic attractor when the bifurcation parameter of the system passes through a critical value. This definition applies equally well either to randomly perturbed motions, or to purely deterministic motions. Our study reveals that the generalized cell mapping method with digraph is also a powerful tool for global analysis of stochastic bifurcation. By this global analysis the mechanism of development, occurrence and evolution of stochastic bifurcation can be explored clearly and vividly. }

The chaos-inducing modulation is then turned off, allowing the loop's original dynamics to capture the signal.
