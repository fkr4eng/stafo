To capture the uniqueness of the linear combination, we can add a new general statement as follows:

```

            - There is an equation:
                - full source code: $x_i = y_i$

This statement expresses that if a vector `x` can be represented by two linear combinations of basis vectors (potentially the same basis vectors with different coefficients, or even different basis vectors within the same basis), then for each corresponding term in the summation, the terms must be equal.  This implies uniqueness when combined with the previous statement about the existence of such a linear combination.  If the basis is the same (`e_i` = `f_i`), it directly implies `x_i` = `y_i`.


This implementation allows for the possibility of different basis vectors within the same basis `b`.  If we want to restrict it to the case where the basis vectors are the same in both linear combinations, we can simply remove `f_i` and `y_i` and replace the second equation with  `x = sum_{i=1}^n y_i e_i` and the assertion with `x_i = y_i`.
